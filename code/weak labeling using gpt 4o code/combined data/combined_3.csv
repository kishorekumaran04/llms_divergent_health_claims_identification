Non-carceral drug punishment can be incredibly debilitating for people as well.,'Defelonization' is merely one possible part of complete decriminalisation. Other methods to help people avoid fines and non-carceral punishments can also be used.,
Fines for the possession or sale of drugs in decriminalized systems can be between hundreds and thousands of dollars.,The average fine for drug possession is likely to have a more temporarily negative impact on an individual than long-term detention would.,

Decriminalisation may be a useful incremental step.",
"While it may not happen immediately, eventually the reduced need to police these areas will become apparent to police as more people buy drugs legally and criminal activity decreases.","Crime and gang activity may initially continue in many areas after legalisation if there is a delay in the drug market shift, so police are likely to continue their current behavior.",
No type of drug reform will be able to stop racist and aggressive policing. Drug legalisation would simply remove one pernicious avenue through which it is justified.,Legalisation will not change many of the structural reasons for which excessive policing occurs in certain areas.,
"If drugs were legalised, the drug trade would be less able to fuel serious crime.","There can exist a correlation between an individual's illicit drug use and their likelihood of committing certain crimes. Thus, while legalisation may lead to reduced crime associated with the sourcing and sale of drugs, it may increase crime associated with actual drug use in communities.",

"With less income, these cartels will have less money to bribe politicians and police officers, which would make corruption within these institutions less likely.","Drug-related corruption in law enforcement agencies can sometimes occur with the goal of incriminating known, harmful drug traffickers who have evaded the law (pp. 90-91).

"The drug industry, like the alcohol and tobacco ones, can be taxed to generate revenue. Some estimates of tax revenue from marijuana legalisation in the US reach $28 billion.",Estimates of tax income from legalisation may be exaggerated.,
The UK made nearly 10 billion pounds from cigarette VAT from 2020 to 2021. This is an indication that taxes on drugs can raise significant funds.,Estimates of tax income from legalisation may be exaggerated.,
