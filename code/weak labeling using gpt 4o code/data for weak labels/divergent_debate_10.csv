Differences between animals and humans mean that results from animal-based research and testing can be invalid for predicting a human response (p. 45).,Animal testing is often used to test the safety of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to minimize harm to humans.,1
Differences between animals and humans mean that results from animal-based research and testing can be invalid for predicting a human response (p. 45).,"Genes can be transferred into rodents to create 'humanized mice', which are used to study diseases and drugs in a way which closely replicates results that might be obtained from human testing.",1
Differences between animals and humans mean that results from animal-based research and testing can be invalid for predicting a human response (p. 45).,"While animal models are an imperfect part of the testing process, they remain an invaluable one.",1
Differences between animals and humans mean that results from animal-based research and testing can be invalid for predicting a human response (p. 45).,"Many animals used in research and testing share over 98% of their DNA with humans, meaning that biologically they are very similar.",1
"Due to variation in physiology and genetics, diseases in animals are often substantially different than diseases in humans, meaning that breakthroughs in solving animal diseases don't necessarily translate to helping people (pp. 415-416).",An animal doesn’t need to be identical to a human to be an effective model. It is enough for it to share biological aspects and responses of the disease or system being studied (p. 138).,1
Animal studies are often poor predictors of human reactions to exposure (p. 1). Therefore it is better to use human test subjects.,The vast majority of biomedical scientists believe that animal studies are essential.,1

"Resources, like scientists and funding, are wasted in animal-based research and testing instead of more effective areas of research, such as human-based studies.",Animal testing is necessary for medical development.,1
"Resources, like scientists and funding, are wasted in animal-based research and testing instead of more effective areas of research, such as human-based studies.","While first-in-human research trials are much more suitable and ethical, they are generally only carried out once pre-clinical trials on non-human subjects have suggested effectiveness and lack of toxicity. As such, they are not likely to replace animal studies in the first instance.",1
"Resources, like scientists and funding, are wasted in animal-based research and testing instead of more effective areas of research, such as human-based studies.",The vast majority of biomedical scientists believe that animal studies are essential.,1
Animal testing is more expensive than alternatives; therefore investing in alternatives is something that corporations are interested in.,"When choosing to invest in scientific advancements, there are more factors for corporations to consider than merely the immediate financial implications (pp. 21-28).",1
"Test animals are often put under extreme stress, which can substantially distort results.",Animals possess certain characteristics which make them good test subjects.,1
"Test animals are often put under extreme stress, which can substantially distort results.",There are strong incentives to reduce stress during the testing process since it harms the reproducibility of experiments (p. 35).,1
"Test animals are often put under extreme stress, which can substantially distort results.","Some evidence suggests that non-human animals can handle greater stress than humans, without incurring (as many) adverse health effects.",1
