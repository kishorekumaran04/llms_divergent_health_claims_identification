Travel bans misidentify the reasons why viruses spread.,Travel bans help to stop the spread of mutations of a virus.,1
Travel bans misidentify the reasons why viruses spread.,International air travel contributed significantly to the spread of Covid-19.,1
The spread of some infectious diseases is caused by the risk-taking activities of citizens irrespective of whether there are travel restrictions in place.,Travel bans ensure that the risk-taking behaviour of individuals is confined to just one country.,1
Air travel is no riskier than other means of travel.,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines contact with an infected person as being seated within two rows of one another which, it suggests, is no different from taking a train or bus or going to the theatre. However, this risk assessment is flawed.",1
Air travel is no riskier than other means of travel.,"Even if air travel poses no greater relative risk to the travelers, it still contributes to the spread of the virus from one region to another.",1
Robust ventilation systems on aircrafts mean that there is very little risk of communicable diseases being transmitted on board.,"If a plane stops to refuel, the air filtration system would be turned off, and may contribute to the spread of Covid-19 on aircraft.",1

"While the researchers considered that the most plausible explanation for the development of SARS in people aboard the flight in the study was that they were infected while on board, they still acknowledged that other explanations were possible.",One study found that WHO's definition for 'contact with an infected person' would have missed 45% of the patients who contracted SARS.,1
There is little evidence to suggest travel bans eliminate the risk of the disease crossing borders in the long term.,The same study found that travel bans may delay the arrival of a virus in a given region by days or even weeks.
