The pandemic is likely to severely affect the long-term psychological well-being of many individuals.,Many people are attempting to combat loneliness and promote the psychological well-being of others. This will help mitigate the psychological toll of the outbreak.,1
"A survey in a convalescent hospital in Hong Kong showed that approximately 50% of recovered SARS patients showed anxiety, and approximately 20% were fearful.","The fact that only 50% of recovered SARS patients showed anxiety proves that contracting SARS was not a sufficient condition to cause anxiety. Thus, the inability to forget distressing memories in these instances, is likely caused by other factors.",1
"People's relationships may suffer under the many stresses of the pandemic, causing considerable anguish.","Self-isolating together may cause people to doubt whether they can enjoy spending time together in the long term. If so, self-isolation now will only accelerate the process of relationships breaking down.",1

"Divorce, which negatively impacts the psychological health of all parties involved, is likely to occur at an increased rate due to the stresses of self-isolating.","Divorce can be an extremely stressful process, and therefore may be more stressful than self-isolating with one's partner. This may dissuade people from filing for divorce.",1
"Divorce, which negatively impacts the psychological health of all parties involved, is likely to occur at an increased rate due to the stresses of self-isolating.","The divorce process can be long and will likely surpass the self-isolation period. Given this, some may decide that on balance divorcing is disproportionate.",1
It has been reported that there has been an uptick in divorce cases across the world since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.,Other reports issued in October 2020 have claimed that divorces are actually down amidst the pandemic.,1
"Social distancing will accelerate the process of driving communication to our screens instead of communicating in person, which is bad for our mental health.","If families are self-isolating together, then they may be communicating more than they would when following their usual busy routines.",1
This could have a deleterious effect on children's social development.,Children are already spending enough time with screens that their social development has been adversely affected.,1
"Children who spend more time engaging with a screen than with other kids or adults can struggle to understand emotion, create strong relationships or become more dependent on others.","For already-isolated children, social media can provide a supportive online community.",1
The increased use of social media has been linked with depression and loneliness.,"In at least some respects, using social media can improve one's mental health.",1
"In several recent studies, teenage and young adult users who spend the most time on Instagram, Facebook and other platforms were shown to have a substantially (from 13-66%) higher rate of reported depression than those who spent the least time.","This correlation may be explained by the fact that many mental health awareness initiatives take place on social media. As such, social media users may be more likely to report depression, rather than social media causing depression in the first place.",1
It is likely that self-isolating will negatively impact many people with underlying mental health conditions.,There are many guides available that provide guidance on how to manage mental health during self-isolation.,1

Decreased social interactions caused by lockdowns and social distancing norms have increased loneliness among people.,Social distancing does not necessarily lead to loneliness.,1
It feels different to be alone because one chooses to be alone compared to having it forced upon you. The latter is coerced because people are not making a choice.,Loneliness among some population groups preceded the pandemic.,1
Lockdowns mandated in response to the pandemic are likely to increase/create loneliness among the elderly due to restrictions on a number of visitors.,Loneliness was regarded as a public health issue long before the pandemic.,1

Clapping and cheering does not improve people's mental health.,"In Turkey at 9 PM, people clap, cheer, whistle, and bang pots to lift spirits and show appreciation for healthcare workers.",1
"People suffering from depression often find it difficult to ask for help. Therefore, initiatives that require them to respond and explain what they need may not be very effective for them.",Many people are attempting to combat loneliness and promote the psychological well-being of others. This will help mitigate the psychological toll of the outbreak.,1
"Many of these initiatives, while commonplace at the beginning of the pandemic, have dwindled in their prominence.",Many people are attempting to combat loneliness and promote the psychological well-being of others. This will help mitigate the psychological toll of the outbreak.,1
