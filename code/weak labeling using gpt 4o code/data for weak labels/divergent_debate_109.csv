"Since thorough investigations and reviews prove that using 5G isn't particularly harmful, it would follow that people's fears regarding this are based on false conspiracies.","While this may be true, as no large studies on the basis for people's fears over 5G usage have been done, the assertion that the fear is mostly baseless is not itself based on any empirical evidence.",1
Most 5G frequencies are too far from ionizing radiation but other non-ionizing radiation does have a thermal effect on the human body.,"Ionizing radiation is not the only potential health risk from 5G cellular. There are known health risks from many types of non-ionizing radiation. One category is thermal effects. Microwaves (as microwave ovens demonstrate) can cause burns, for example.",1
This is just speculation. It is also possible no health impacts of 5G might be discovered.,"According to the World Health Organization, although no harmful health effects have been linked to wireless technologies, ""only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G"". If more studies are carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G, it is possible negative health impacts of 5G might be discovered.",1
"The Swiss have embarked upon a moratorium over 5G ehtrust.org As the biological effects of EMF in general and 5G, in particular, are still being debated, potential claims for health impairments may come with a long latency.

For example, $30 million NTP studies took more than 10 years to complete and were the most comprehensive assessment of health effects in animals exposed to RFR with modulations used in 2G and 3G cell phones. The studies found that high exposure to RFR (900 MHz) used by 2G and 3G cell phones was associated with heart, brain and adrenal gland cancers in rats. Source: ntp.niehs.nih.gov",1
