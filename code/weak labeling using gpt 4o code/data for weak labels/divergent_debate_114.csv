These trials currently pay participants. There is no reason to believe that participation in these trials would not be enough for those looking to make money off participation in drug trials.,1
People in desperate need of money from the trials have an incentive to lie and/or exaggerate symptoms in order to get selected and continue to receive money from the trials. A random selection would eliminate the possibility of the trials being corrupted in that way.,Phase II and III trials - those with people suffering from the relevant condition - often do not pay participants anyway; the payment is the treatment.,1

"There are many illnesses that can easily be faked - for example, most mental illnesses. These types of illnesses would then be disproportionately vulnerable to poor quality trials, as people willing to engage in this tactic would all channel towards trials for treatments for these particular illnesses.","It is hardly possible that people can exaggerate symptoms that are common entry criteria for clinical trials, e.g. having a particular type of cancer, a certain treatment history, or having a certain age. (Roche, p.4)",1
"If we make payment for non-voluntary participants contingent on proper completion, people will follow the course correctly.","Willing participants are more likely to follow the prescribed course of treatment, which is critical for good research and for their safety.

"Faster approval processes have led to the proliferation of lower-quality drugs. For example, about 85-90% of new drugs don't offer any health benefits to patients over existing drugs.","More stringent trial requirements can lead to delays in the release of drugs, which can be incredibly harmful.

People in desperate need of money from the trials have an incentive to lie and/or exaggerate symptoms in order to get selected and continue to receive money from the trials. A random selection would eliminate the possibility of the trials being corrupted in that way.,The first phase of human trials involves testing in healthy subjects to determine safe dosage levels and identify side-effects. These trials currently pay participants. There is no reason to believe that participation in these trials would not be enough for those looking to make money off participation in drug trials.,1
People in desperate need of money from the trials have an incentive to lie and/or exaggerate symptoms in order to get selected and continue to receive money from the trials.

"There are many illnesses that can easily be faked - for example, most mental illnesses. These types of illnesses would then be disproportionately vulnerable to poor quality trials, as people willing to engage in this tactic would all channel towards trials for treatments for these particular illnesses.","It is hardly possible that people can exaggerate symptoms that are common entry criteria for clinical trials, e.g. having a particular type of cancer, a certain treatment history, or having a certain age.

"Faster approval processes have led to the proliferation of lower-quality drugs. For example, about 85-90% of new drugs don't offer any health benefits to patients over existing drugs.","More stringent trial requirements can lead to delays in the release of drugs, which can be incredibly harmful.

"Easier testing means that alternative drugs for the same condition can make it to the market more quickly, increasing competitive pressures and driving down prices.","Even if drugs are produced more efficiently, it does not mean that they will ultimately end up being cheaper.

"Many trials are live-in, and even when they are not, they can significantly restrict the ability to engage in such activities, by requiring regular check-ins and supervised dosages or check-ups.","Drug trials offer a form of 'passive income' where participants have a large degree of free time which they can use for childcare, education, or job hunting.",1

For example, crab fishing is a dangerous job and many fishermen make six-figure salaries annually.",1
The vast majority of those who have participated in medical trials state the financial rewards as the main incentive to do so.,An interest in the financial rewards for participation in drug trials does not mean that the participants in question are actually in urgent need of this money.

Many medical trials fail because of an insufficient number of participants. This policy would solve this problem and make medical trials more effective.,We needed a draft in order to make sure we had enough soldiers because volunteers were not enough. We have enough volunteers for medical studies.,1
Many medical trials fail because of an insufficient number of participants. This policy would solve this problem and make medical trials more effective.,Pharmaceutical companies should increase their social networking/marketing spending to ensure that they can attract enough patients.,1
Many medical trials fail because of an insufficient number of participants. This policy would solve this problem and make medical trials more effective.,When trial participants are distributed over the entire US it will be more expensive to monitor the participants and provide proper care for them. This will result in worse care and higher trial costs.,1
19% of surveyed medical trials failed because they were unable to attract the number of patients necessary to take place or produce reliable results.,If a study was unable to attract the number of participants needed it probably was not a very important or necessary trial.,1
"Many of the most urgent medical challenges may have potential cures with particularly extreme side-effects, making it hard for relevant trials to attract participants.",If a study was unable to attract the number of participants needed it probably was not a very important or necessary trial.,1
Many of the most socially important studies may suffer from fundraising issues that prevent them offering good compensation for their trial.,If a study was unable to attract the number of participants needed it probably was not a very important or necessary trial.,1
"This could be due to research being conducted by small companies, unable to match the larger funding available to companies researching popular lifestyle drugs (e.g. viagra replacements, weight loss medication).","The vast majority of studies are done by large corporations, so funding issues are more a result of prioritization than access.",1
"Given that lifestyle drugs are more likely to be more profitable than, say, a drug to treat Huntington's, companies are likely to devote more resources to the drug more likely to be profitable.","The vast majority of studies are done by large corporations, so funding issues are more a result of prioritization than access.",1
It is evidently quite difficult to recruit study participants. Thus a study failing due to lack of sample size is more likely to be a result of compensation offered or poor advertising methods.,If a study was unable to attract the number of participants needed it probably was not a very important or necessary trial.,1
"The most common problem that recruiters for medical trials face is the ""finding or identifying patients who meet eligibility criteria"", as one survey concludes. Randomly choosing participants from the population would solve this problem.","In order to obtain a valid sample size of appropriate participants, a tremendous number of people's files would have to be accessed, which is a large invasion of privacy.",1
"If the data is truly collected through anonymised files and only rarely decoded, it's unclear why this harms anyone, or why individuals have a reason to oppose this.","In order to obtain a valid sample size of appropriate participants, a tremendous number of people's files would have to be accessed, which is a large invasion of privacy.",1
Much of this process could be automated through a series of data filters.,"In order to obtain a valid sample size of appropriate participants, a tremendous number of people's files would have to be accessed, which is a large invasion of privacy.",1
"While diseases do not threaten the nation as such, they are devastating for its people. In 2016, cancer alone killed more Americans than the two World Wars and the Vietnam War combined.",Military drafts are employed when there are insufficient voluntary recruits to meet an existential threat. That is not the case here.,1

"The majority of people would not be directly affected by this policy, but they would be exposed to positive media coverage of instances where the policy produce benefits.
