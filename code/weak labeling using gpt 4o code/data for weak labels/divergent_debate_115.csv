There is more food available than can be eaten. Obese people just eating more will not cause more research into GMOs.,"Because obese people consume more, there will be a rise in demand for foodstuff products. To fulfill this demand, GMO research will be necessary.",1

It is discriminatory to shame people for an involuntary characteristic.,Obesity is not an involuntary characteristic for the vast majority of the obese population. Eating less is almost alway possible and it is almost always more healthy to be at a lower weight than be obese.,1
"This makes fat shaming directly analogous to other forms of discrimination, like racism and sexism.","You can *choose* whether to be overweight or not.
