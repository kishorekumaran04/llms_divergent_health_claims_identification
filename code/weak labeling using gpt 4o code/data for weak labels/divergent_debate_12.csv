"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",Not eating the meat of animals killed for other purposes would be a waste and thus morally wrong.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",A great many human activities cause the deaths of animals. A focus on meat leads to moral inconsistency and potential hypocrisy.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",Eating meat is not immoral; the production of meat can be cruel but the consumption is not.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","If everyone who cares about the ethical treatment of animals were to stop eating meat, then the only people farming and consuming meat would be those who lack compassion for the animals. Human's relationship with nature should be one of mutual respect and compassion - this will never happen if those who would put this in practice choose instead to have no symbiotic relationship with nature at all.",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","While much meat farming is cruel, it does not have to be. Ethical consumers could choose only to buy from ethical sources (i.e. free range farming) that afford animals the same (if not better) quality of life than they would have had in the wild, and a painless death.",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",So many people are worried about animals but don't even think twice when walking by a homeless person on the streets. It's preposterous. How about we worry about our own kind first and then start talking about animals.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","Morality is subjective, so eating meat is not necessarily immoral.",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",Ceasing to eat meat would mean that vast quantities of livestock would die without being replaced as they are unable to survive effectively outside of human agriculture.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","Given that meat is still the primary food source for many people in less fortunate countries. Given that human bodies vary wildly in which foods they will process more efficiently. Given that some conditions will actually make eating plant only foods a negative life choice for many. It is cruel and immoral to presume that no human should eat meat under any circumstances. The above claim completely ignores the quality of life of other humans, making the claim itself cruel and immoral.",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",Consuming vegetables is also cruel to both the plants and to the workers responsible for the agricultural process.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","The statement is unclear as it is not specified what the ""majority of cases"" are. What delineates those from the others, supposedly not cruel or not immoral?",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","Moral values are typically pertinent to particular individuals, groups, religions or schools of thought. There are no universally accepted moral values that condemn eating meat or treating animals in any particular way. Therefore the statement that eating meat can involve immoral treatment, is false.",1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.",Farming vegetarian products also directly or indirectly harms animals in the process of crop production and harvest.,1
"Eating meat, in the majority of cases, involves the cruel and immoral treatment of animals.","Since meat eating is in human nature, it cannot be immoral.",1

All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"A chicken or cow doesn't have any frame of reference, and hence doesn't know what a good or bad life is. We like to attribute meaning to our own lifes and subsequently, animals livesÂ too. If a chicken does not know what it is like to live in the wilderness then is it suffering inside?",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"Some animals, who due to their reproduction disturb a natural balance, need to be killed in order to preserve biodiversity. This is the case with rabbits on the German island Norderney where the rabbits were accidentally brought to the island by humans.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"Animals do not have ""rights"" at all. They live in a state of eat or be eaten. Rights do not exist in the natural world at all, only in the socially constructed world that humans have created for themselves.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"""Human rights"" are not laws of the universe but rather a practical tool humans use to govern interaction with each other. They are a means of outlining and governing acceptable behavior so that we may live peacefully with each other. We can do this because we can communicate with each other and hold each other accountable. We cannot communicate with other species and hold them accountable in the same way yet.  A wolf does not understand, and will not respect, a universal right to life.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"Even if animals did live free of human slaughter, they would most likely die due to consumption by predators anyways so you might as well use the animals in a way that benefits humans.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"It would be good to eradicate certain Mosquitos and parasites, so they cannot have such a right.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,This statement is illogically selective. Why it should apply to just animals versus all living things? Why do all plants or microbes not have a right to live and be free of suffering?,1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,Animals bred for meat would not exist if their meat was not to be consumed. Wherein does their right to life reside if nobody is willing to create the circumstances of their existence?,1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"Without the raising of animals for slaughter, they wouldn't have had a life in the first place. They are fed and raised to maturity.",1
All animals have a right to live and be free of suffering.,"The type of intensive agriculture required to produce vegetarian food on a scale to feed current populations inherently causes the death of animals. To plant acres of soy one must displace every single animal living there, eradicate every bird, mouse, squirrel that would eat the crop, poison every insect, grind up every creature in the path of the harvester, etc. Farming is an ecological disaster that represents death to every living being that is not the crop.",1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.","Humans are at the top of the food chain, which means that they are merely following the natural order of things when they kill and eat other animals.",1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.",Plants are living as well and yet nobody seems to have a problem with harvesting them for consumption.,1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.","It is natural to eat whatever is convenient, even if it is not strictly necessary for survival. Bears, for example, are omnivores yet eat meat whenever the opportunity arises.",1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.",It is not the decision of one person what another puts into their bodies.,1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.",This argument is based off an internally judged moral system. None of the claims have hard fact behind them. Confidence brings verisimilitude but has no effect on actual truth. Proper justification is based on reality not personal preference.,1
"Killing an animal can only be justified by extreme necessities, such as survival; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is thus not justifiable.",Such an act is justifiable from a hedonistic standpoint.,1
Killing animals to satisfy an unnecessary dietary preference creates disproportionate and unnecessary suffering.,"Killing can take place without suffering, for example through gas and in environments that do not induce stress.",1
Killing animals to satisfy an unnecessary dietary preference creates disproportionate and unnecessary suffering.,"If the issue is ""unnecessary suffering"" then the killing of the animal is not intrinsically wrong nor is eating meat. Causing ""unnecessary suffering"" is wrong.",1

This does not change the fact that it is about satisfying an unnecessary dietary preference and not necessary for actual survival.,"If unnecessary is defined as ""not necessary for survival"" and if ""not necessary for survival"" is the reason given for why eating meat is wrong, then the logical extension of this view is to stop masturbating and producing art since both of these activities can be construed to be not strictly necessary for survival.",1
"The species found most often in cave paintings were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones. The most common animal hunting and meat consumption practices in the stone-age have not, therefore, necessarily made significant contribution to this part of human cultural history.","Some of the oldest forms of human expression and art are cave paintings of wild game, prey of humans. The chase and consumption of meat have therefore constituted a central component of human culture since its beginning.",1
"Conspicuous consumption has been explained in the context of humans' nature, and with an eye on sexual selection and signaling, similar to the evolutionary utility peacock's tails.","Many humans like to buy luxury products like fancy watches, clothes and cars.",1
Research and science does in fact assist our survival by enabling us to deal with threats that may not be apparent to a lay individual.,Humans do research and science.,1
"Unlike consumption of meat, the vast majority of all science, art, culture and languages comes without the infliction of suffering and harm to other living beings.","Most of humans' behaviour is not necessary to survive, yet they do it if it enriches their daily lives.",1
"If much of humans' behaviour is not necessary for survival, it should be judged depending on the impact of that behaviour. While much of it, such as creating and and research, do not cause harm to others, eating meat is an example where extreme harm is caused, which means the behaviour is not justified.","Most of humans' behaviour is not necessary to survive, yet they do it if it enriches their daily lives.",1
"Those activities are generally not harmful to other living things. Bestiality, for instance, is illegal and morally frowned upon.","If unnecessary is defined as ""not necessary for survival"" and if ""not necessary for survival"" is the reason given for why eating meat is wrong, then the logical extension of this view is to stop masturbating and producing art since both of these activities can be construed to be not strictly necessary for survival.",1

"98.8% of human and chimp DNA is the same, and they are so similar because they are closely related.","Although humans and chimps have very similar DNA, they often use their genes in different ways, and therefore there are still big differences in the behaviour of chimps and humans.",1
"98.8% of human and chimp DNA is the same, and they are so similar because they are closely related.","The basis of this argument is fundamentally wrong. Whenever something is placed on a scale of ""closeness"" to something else, based on what is used, there will always be something closer than other things.

"There is considerable ongoing debate on what markers of intelligence are important. The current strong candidate is brain wrinkling. There is behavioural evidence to suggest classes of more advanced species. For example, higher mammals such as dolphins and elephants display what appears to be funeral/burial behaviours.

There is some evidence that elements of pain perception do relate to evolutionary advancements.","Brain size on its own is meaningless, but brain size in proportion to body size is a consistent index of animal intellectual development",1
"There is no inherent difference between animals and humans; to insist otherwise is speciesism, the act of discriminating against a being on the basis of their species.","It is not speciesist to point out the inherent differences in our thought processes, reasonings, technological leaps, and our huge impact on the Earth's environments, both positive and negative.
