Cell phone radiation may cause cancer.,"Usage of cell phones has increased rapidly from 0% to >90% over a few decades, while brain cancer rates have dropped or remained the same over the same time period. (Graph)",1
Cell phone radiation may cause cancer.,"Cell/Wi-Fi photons are in the GHz, which is non-ionizing radiation, far below the energy levels needed to cause DNA damage.",1
Cell phone radiation may cause cancer.,"The study that suggested this has been repeated several times and similar experiments and meta analysis have been done, but the result could not be replicated.",1
"The World Health Organization has classified cell phones as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer.",The WHO has not found any conclusive evidence to classify cell phones as carcinogenic.,1
"The World Health Organization has classified cell phones as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer.","The World Health Organisation categorises everything they cannot prove to be absolutely not carcinogenic nor as carcinogenic as possibly carcinogenic

"The thesis does not refer explicitly to brain cancer, but to harm in general.","Usage of cell phones has increased rapidly from 0% to >90% over a few decades, while brain cancer rates have dropped or remained the same over the same time period. (Graph)",1
Molecularly-damaging radiation extends below the ionizing threshold: splitting covalent bonds in molecules and generating free radicals requires only 3-4 eV.,"Cell/Wi-Fi photons are in the GHz, which is non-ionizing radiation, far below the energy levels needed to cause DNA damage.",1
Molecularly-damaging radiation extends below the ionizing threshold: splitting covalent bonds in molecules and generating free radicals requires only 3-4 eV.,"This is still 120,000 times as much energy as Wi-Fi photons.",1
Non-ionizing radiation can still cause health risks through thermal effects (like burns).,"Cell/Wi-Fi photons are in the GHz, which is non-ionizing radiation, far below the energy levels needed to cause DNA damage.",1
Non-ionizing radiation can still cause health risks through thermal effects (like burns).,"Although the claim is technically true, it's practically false since we can perceive and respond to the thermal increases (ie pull the phone away when it feels hot).",1
Pulsed radiation produced by GSM phones is more harmful than continuous radiation produced by CDMA phones.,"""More harmful"" is meaningless without a magnitude.  Consider if proposition A can be shown to cause harm in 1/10,000 cases and proposition B can be shown to cause harm in 1/10,001 cases, A is by definition ""more harmful"" but the magnitude is still irrelevant.",1
"The study referenced in the parent claim mentioned a near doubling in radiation density for gsm over cdma. This means that twice as much radiation can be emitted from cdma devices at the same time, with radiation being more dangerous when absorbed in higher doses over a shorter period of time, than in lower doses over a longer period.","""More harmful"" is meaningless without a magnitude.

Cell phone radiation is absorbed more by children's brains than by adult's brains.,"Even if this statement were proven true, it's easy to protect against since adults can decide whether or not to buy their children phones or limit their use.",1
Cell phone radiation is absorbed more by children's brains than by adult's brains.,"The question of whether it’s absorbed more or less by children’s brains is completely irrelevant to the question of whether it is harmful. If it were proven harmful at some threshold, then this might be relevant.",1
Cell phone radiation is absorbed more by children's brains than by adult's brains.,The study referenced found that the thinner skull of a child's head pass trough about twice the amount of radiation then mentioned that the amount of absorbed radiation has been found to be the same for children and adults.,1
"After exposing rats to radiation from a cell phone, Salford et al. found that those rats with higher exposure to radiation had a tendency to produce more dark neurons.",Salford et al. found that *lower* levels of radiation caused *greater* amount of albumin leakage.,1
There has been several lawsuits throughout the world where court ruled in favor of cancer victim and against mobile industry.,"Equally, companies would have been sued by customers in large, class-action cases. Such cases - if brought - have not been successful.",1
"Tobacco smoking is well understood to be dangerous to both the smoker and the public at large. It is a worldwide public health concern, yet it is not restricted.","If there were evidence for any serious harm caused, phones and Wi-Fi would not be widely available but restricted by customer protection laws.",1
"Tobacco smoking is well understood to be dangerous to both the smoker and the public at large. It is a worldwide public health concern, yet it is not restricted.","Although tobacco can still be purchased, there are a number of trading restrictions on the product.",1
"Tobacco smoking is well understood to be dangerous to both the smoker and the public at large. It is a worldwide public health concern, yet it is not restricted.",Many countries restrict Tobacco smoking in areas where it could effect others. e.g. in bars or restaurants,1
"Society hasn't been able to witness the effects of cellphone usage as the millenial generation, who were born with cellphones, have not lived to die yet. Due to this, a decreased mortality rate has not yet been observed and there is no evidence that cellphone use and wifi use cause harm thus no action and laws have been established to prevent society from harm.","If there were evidence for any serious harm caused, phones and Wi-Fi would not be widely available but restricted by customer protection laws.",1
"In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phone radiation possibly carcinogenic, means that there could be some risk of carcinogenicity.",The effects of cell phones and Wi-Fi are minimal at best.,1
"In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phone radiation possibly carcinogenic, means that there could be some risk of carcinogenicity.","The research claimed that there could be some risk with heavy use of cell phones. This is hardly significant, particularly if people simply use their phones with moderation.",1
Some studies suggest that frequent exposure to this heat could alter brain cell activity.,"The main effect of non-ionizing radiation on body tissue is heating, which in itself is not harmful.",1
"Even if the radiation isn't harmful in small doses in the short term, it is still unclear if long-term exposure to non-ionising radiation can cause health problem.","Cell phones and Wi-Fi emit non-ionising radiation, which is not harmful in small doses.",1
