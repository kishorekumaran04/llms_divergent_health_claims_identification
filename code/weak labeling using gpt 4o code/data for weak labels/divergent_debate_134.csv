A delayed start time could help teens sleep during their natural sleep/wake cycles.,"Matching sleep cycles depends on when teenagers choose to go to sleep. This will not be the same for every student. Rather than attempting to match what teenagers want, schools should set out a time and students should go to sleep in time to adapt to it.",1
