Diseases are better managed by pharmacists.,"Pharmacists are not adequately trained in assessment or diagnosis, and would be unable to reliably distinguish between a patient's response to a drug; a change in the patient's existing disease state; and the development a new, unrelated condition. This could result in increased harm to patients.",1
Diseases are better managed by pharmacists.,"Without pharmacist access to laboratory values, patient medical records, and other crucial health information, patient drug therapy is best managed by family physicians at this time, as they have the most complete picture of a patient's health state.",1
Physicians are not the only people with the judgement and expertise to determine if a medication is needed. Pharmacists share in this judgement.,"The practice of clinical medicine is an art, and as such, requires a medical provider's judgment and expertise to determine if and when a medication is needed.",1

"The question is whether pharmacists should prescribe, not diagnose. The two acts do not necessarily go hand in hand. A pharmacist could prescribe based on a physician's diagnosis or assessment.","Pharmacists are not adequately trained in assessment or diagnosis, and would be unable to reliably distinguish between a patient's response to a drug; a change in the patient's existing disease state; and the development a new, unrelated condition. This could result in increased harm to patients.",1
"Many pharmacists work in collaborative settings such as FHT's, hospitals, and pharmacy-clinic settings where access to patient records is easily facilitated.","Without pharmacist access to laboratory values, patient medical records, and other crucial health information, patient drug therapy is best managed by family physicians at this time, as they have the most complete picture of a patient's health state.",1
A major contributor to shortfalls in delivery of recommended health care services is lack of physician time.,"Without pharmacist access to laboratory values, patient medical records, and other crucial health information, patient drug therapy is best managed by family physicians at this time, as they have the most complete picture of a patient's health state.",1
Allowing pharmacists to prescribe medications saves healthcare costs.,"Since pharmacists are not intensively trained to handle complex diseases like cancer and congenital heart failure, any miscalculation in prescription is likely to further deteriorate their health, thereby increasing healthcare costs.",1
Pharmacists can encourage patients to regularly adhere to prescribed medicines and reduce the failure of treatment therapies.,"Pharmacists can encourage patients to adhere to their medications, even without an expanded scope of practice.",1
"With pharmacist prescribing authority, a patient's drug therapy could be centralized around the pharmacist, thus still ensuring that one practitioner is the sole manager of a patient's drug therapy.","Allowing additional healthcare professionals to prescribe would increase the fragmentation that already exists within the healthcare system, contributing to polypharmacy and confusion for the patient and other professionals.",1
Pharmacists themselves strongly support pharmacist-initiated prescribing and feel they are ready for the additional responsibility.,"Allowing additional healthcare professionals to prescribe would increase the fragmentation that already exists within the healthcare system, contributing to polypharmacy and confusion for the patient and other professionals.",1
"Pharmaceutical companies already do this with physicians, yet that is no reason to take prescribing authority away from the medical profession.","If pharmacists gain the authority to prescribe, pharmaceutical companies will begin to offer gifts and incentives to bias pharmacists towards prescribing the company's medication over competitors'. This will cloud pharmacists' clinical judgement",1

Pharmacies could renovate to include a private area,"That requires a large infrastructure overhaul, which is expensive and may not be feasible.",1
Many pharmacies already have acoustically private counselling areas which would be appropriate for most prescribing-related activities,"Medical clinics have private rooms, in the form of examination rooms, to discuss patient care, whereas most pharmacies lack such private rooms.",1
"Many pharmacists work in hospitals, clinics, and other non-pharmacy organisations which have acoustically and visually private rooms and areas.","Medical clinics have private rooms, in the form of examination rooms, to discuss patient care, whereas most pharmacies lack such private rooms.",1
