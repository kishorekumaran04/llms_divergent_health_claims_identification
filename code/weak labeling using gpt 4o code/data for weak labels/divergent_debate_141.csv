Motorized vehicles take less effort to ride than bicycles.,"Riding a bicycle is a form of exercise, and as scooters take less effort even than walking, they will contribute to obesity.",1
Motorized vehicles take less effort to ride than bicycles.,"Handling scooters gets exhausting for the arms and legs, and especially so on bumpy roads. A bike makes for a smoother and therefore less exhausting ride.",1
"The distances covered on scooters are usually so short that, even if they'd be covered by bike or via walking, they wouldn't amount to a significant exercise.","Riding a bicycle is a form of exercise, and as scooters take less effort even than walking, they will contribute to obesity.",1
The vehicles are small enough to ride on the sidewalk or in a bicycle lane.,"In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to operate an electric scooter on the sidewalk.",1
The vehicles are small enough to ride on the sidewalk or in a bicycle lane.,This is problematic. Many scooters go fast enough to become a threat for pedestrians.,1
"Electric scooters provide gig work for ""juicers"" who collect and charge the scooters.",This puts people into a precarious situation in which they work without a contract and are fully dependent on the terms offered by the companies operating the scooters.,1
"A few electric scooter companies are ""unicorns"" valued at over $1 billion.",The long-term profitability of these firms has yet to be determined.,1
"A few electric scooter companies are ""unicorns"" valued at over $1 billion.",Increasing regulations and mergers are likely to lower the value of these companies.,1
The high demand for scooters shows that they are filling a niche in the short-distance transportation market.,It is not yet foreseeable whether this high demand is the result of a short-team hype or indicative of long-term prospects.,1
Electric scooters are a convenient form of transportation.,It is not possible to transport anything that doesn't fit into a small bag or backpack on a scooter.,1
Electric scooters are a convenient form of transportation.,One cannot rely on scooters for transport since one can never be sure whether one is available when and where needed.,1
Electric scooters are a convenient form of transportation.,The convenience of using scooters is highly dependent on the weather.,1
Electric scooters are a convenient form of transportation.,Riding scooters is bumpy - that's anything but convenient.,1
Electric scooters are a convenient form of transportation.,The type of terrain that electric scooters can cover is limited.,1
There are several electric scooter models that are capable of ascending hills.,Many of the models don't have enough horsepower to ascend hills.,1
It is up to the municipal authorities to make sure that the road is properly maintained so that such hazards are not an issue.,The wheels are much smaller and thus less able to roll over obstacles like potholes and gaps or bumps in the road.,1
"This does not take away from their utility in areas where they work well. Other means of transport, too, suffer from limitations in terms of the terrain they can cover.",The type of terrain that electric scooters can cover is limited.,1
"This might be a matter of everybody getting used to people on scooters in cities. As time passes, this problem is likely to become less severe.","Drivers are not accustomed to seeing a cyclist standing up on his vehicle. Thus, car drivers can be confused and assume that a scooter rider is a pedestrian walking, whereas the top speed of a pedestrian is much slower than that of an e-scooter.",1
"Escooters are often used on sidewalks and traditional pedestrian areas that are more protected from vehicle transit lanes,while cyclists are legally restricted from using pedestrian paths and are either on shared streets (share-os) or cycling lanes which are up against traffic.",E-scooters are more likely to get in a collision with other vehicles than are bicycles.,1
"Escooters are often used on sidewalks and traditional pedestrian areas that are more protected from vehicle transit lanes,while cyclists are legally restricted from using pedestrian paths and are either on shared streets (share-os) or cycling lanes which are up against traffic.","In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to operate an electric scooter on the sidewalk.",1
"Although e-scooters may result in more accidents than bicycles, these accidents are less likely to result in death.",E-scooters are more likely to get in a collision with other vehicles than are bicycles.,1

"Although e-scooters may result in more accidents than bicycles, these accidents are less likely to result in death.",They are far more dangerous than bicycles.,1
"Escooters are often used on sidewalks and traditional pedestrian areas that are more protected from vehicle transit lanes,while cyclists are legally restricted from using pedestrian paths and are either on shared streets (share-os) or cycling lanes which are up against traffic.","In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to operate an electric scooter on the sidewalk.",1
This is a problem that can easily be solved.,"People often leave scooters around a city, which clutters sidewalks and looks bad.",1
Some companies that rent out scooters already require users to submit a photo of how they parked the scooter after use to ensure that they are not left where they shouldn't be.,"Riders often fail to properly take a post-ride photo of their parking job, and companies have little incentive to penalize such users.",1
The average trip length of scooters is - in the case of Bird - less than 2 miles. The batteries of scooters can easily cover that.,They have a short battery life.,1
"As long as the battery lasts for a day, this hardly matters since scooters get commonly charged at night when hardly anyone requires them anyway.",It can take several hours for a depleted battery to fully charge.,1
"As long as the battery lasts for a day, this hardly matters since scooters get commonly charged at night when hardly anyone requires them anyway.",That scooters aren't available at night takes away from their utility since they could compensate for the absence of public transport at that time.,1
The battery can be charged by plugging in an adapter to any standard outlet.,There are drawbacks to current battery technology.,1
Electric scooters are better for the environment than cars.,There are environmental costs involved.,1
Electric scooters are better for the environment than cars.,Most people probably don't replace car rides with scooter rides since the former tend to be much longer than the latter.,1
Many expensive things are good for people. Price does not determine the effects something has.,The use of rentable scooters is expensive.,1
Many expensive things are good for people. Price does not determine the effects something has.,"Yet a high price can limit the positive effects something has. If scooters are a great in principle but too expensive for these benefits to materialize, they are - in practice - not all that great.",1
"Prices are likely to go down once the initial hype subsides, public interest goes down and the companies operating the scooters have to keep people interested.",The use of rentable scooters is expensive.,1
