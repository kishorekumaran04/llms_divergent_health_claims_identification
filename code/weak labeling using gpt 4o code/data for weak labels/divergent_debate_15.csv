Providing free vaccination for one harmful virus is better than providing no vaccination at all. Increasing the scope of this policy could be a future consideration.,It would not make sense to provide free vaccination for one harmful virus and not all.,1
"Each vaccine must be evaluated separately based on disease burden, vaccine efficacy, vaccine effects, and the logistical considerations (including cost) of widespread immunization policies.",It would not make sense to provide free vaccination for one harmful virus and not all.,1
Many countries offer readily available vaccinations for harmful viruses for free.,There are many vaccinations for harmful/deadly viruses that are not provided for free. Doing so for HPV is not necessary.,1
"In the UK, vaccinations such as the 6-in-1 vaccine and PCV vaccine are administered free of charge.",The UK has a universal healthcare system in place that many countries do not. This makes it easier to offer free vaccines.,1
"In Germany, vaccinations for adults are covered by insurance. Vaccinations for children are free.","Germany has an established public health care system that can more readily cover the cost of free vaccines. Many countries, like the US, do not.",1
Sixty-nine NCI-Designated Cancer Centers stated the low rates of people vaccinating against HPV is a 'serious public health threat.'.,The World Health Organization has prioritized several diseases and viruses that have the potential to be a public health emergency. HPV is not one of them.,1

"Authorities can put more effort into making sure poor communities have better access, but they will still be needed for free.","Some poor communities have less access to HPV vaccination protocols, even when available for free.",1
Providing it for free to everyone would prevent fraudulent administration.,"This indicates a need for poorer communities to receive the vaccine for free, not everyone.",1
It will increase awareness of the vaccine.,"Making the vaccine free, per se, is unlikely to increase awareness. Awareness would be increased by commercial advertising, which would be expected if a company stood to profit from increased uptake of the vaccine, or by making the vaccine mandatory (which it already is in most U.S. states); thus confronting each patient/ parent with a necessary discussion and decision about the vaccine.",1
It will increase awareness of the vaccine.,"Awareness increases with proper advertising and education, which leads to more people receiving the vaccination. Not the other way around.",1

Many places offer free flu vaccinations due to its prevalence and easy contraction. The same can be available for HPV.,"Per year, the flu has the ability to spread, affect and kill more people than HPV.",1
"This is a first-world-centric comparison, because the death rate from cervical cancer in the U.S. is affected by access to cervical cancer screening (Pap smears) and intervention for early, pre-cancerous lesions. The death rate worldwide is very comparable for the two conditions: 266.000 deaths annually from cervical cancer, and ""290 to 650,000"" deaths annually from flu.","In comparison, approximately 44,000 new cases of HPV-related cancers were diagnosed in the US between 2012 and 2016",1
