No such biomarkers exist to prove that a COVID-19 vaccine caused any specific side effect.",1
"This is a false equivalence, as the polio vaccine was a vaccine that prevented both disease and transmission, while the COVID-19 vaccines only prevent disease and not transmission. The polio vaccine is a long-lasting countermeasure as opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine which doesn't protect against all strains.",The latest evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are indeed effective at preventing transmission.,1
"Estimating the risk of the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly complex, multifarious process, made even more complex by the rarity of the blood clots in question. Altogether, a simple comparison between the general population and vaccinated individuals has ""major limitations.""","In order to claim that something caused something else, one would generally expect to have a group incidence rate higher than that of the general population.",1
Comparing blood clots in the general population to blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine is not an apples to apples comparison as there are many more risk factors associated with blood clots.,"The major cause for concern with the AstraZeneca vaccine is blood clotting. However, the expected rate of blood clots in the general population is actually higher than the rate of reported blood clots among vaccinated patients.",1
Comparing blood clots in the general population to blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine is not an apples to apples comparison as there are many more risk factors associated with blood clots.,"It is reasonable to compare the number of blood clots among vaccinated persons and the general population. The vaccinated group is meant to reflect the composition of the general population, therefore it presumably contains all the same risk factors for blood clots.",1
"In fact, the blood clotting disorder that occurs after vaccination is a novel phenomenon that shouldn't be compared to the disorder at other times since it normally isn't associated with the immune system.","However, these factors are associated with COVID-19 at large and could theoretically be related to the immune response from the vaccine. There is a fairly common exaggerated immune response to the virus, causing serious problems including clotting.",1
The most recent data indicate that the rate of blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine is just slightly higher than expected rates in the general population.,"The major cause for concern with the AstraZeneca vaccine is blood clotting. However, the expected rate of blood clots in the general population is actually higher than the rate of reported blood clots among vaccinated patients.",1
"If there is enough correlation, vaccine rollout should be paused in order to better investigate the cause.","Without a burden of proof, vaccine rollout should not be suspended. Correlation does not imply causation.",1
"If there is enough correlation, vaccine rollout should be paused in order to better investigate the cause.","This is ill-advised; a large number of these side effects and especially the vast majority of, if not all, deaths would have occurred with or without the vaccine.",1
Several countries did pause the implementation of the AstraZeneca vaccine pending further investigation; it then conducted its own studies and set varied regulatory limits on who could receive this shot.,The fact that each EU country has had its own constantly-changing policies towards the vaccine has confused the public.,1
"Europe's medical regulator has clearly stated that it could not rule out a link between the vaccine and blood clots, and that a casual link is possible and deserves further analysis.","Without a burden of proof, vaccine rollout should not be suspended. Correlation does not imply causation.",1
"Europe's medical regulator has clearly stated that it could not rule out a link between the vaccine and blood clots, and that a casual link is possible and deserves further analysis.","Due to the extremely low risk of clotting, this is not a reason to stop distribution. Temporarily altering the guidelines should be sufficient.",1
Norwegian and German researchers have identified an antibody created by the vaccine that causes the clots.,"As the clotting symptoms can be diagnosed with a blood test, people shouldn't fear the vaccine since it can now be treated.",1
AstraZeneca has used outdated data in the past in stating the effectiveness of the vaccine.,"Companies are not immutable; there is typically some degree of turnover among employees and executives. As such, past transgressions cannot be used to predict future performance.",1
A woman sought immediate treatment after experiencing symptoms from the vaccine. She still died from a blood clot. Seeking treatment does not prevent clots forming in a patient's body.,"Following the advice and instructions of health care providers, people who receive the vaccine can monitor their symptoms and seek immediate treatment to address and prevent these clots.",1
It should not be the burden of the patient to seek additional medical care after the fact of receiving the vaccine; some may not have the time or monetary means to seek further treatment.,"As the clotting symptoms can be diagnosed with a blood test, people shouldn't fear the vaccine since it can now be treated.",1
It should not be the burden of the patient to seek additional medical care after the fact of receiving the vaccine; some may not have the time or monetary means to seek further treatment.,No-fault compensation programs exist where claimants can seek compensation if they receive injuries arising from vaccines recommended by the government.,1
AstraZeneca has struck a deal with many European nations that would partially alleviate the company's liability.,"In most countries, AstraZeneca will likely be liable for damages caused by its vaccine.",1
AstraZeneca has struck a deal with many European nations that would partially alleviate the company's liability.,"Wealthy European nations are far more likely to grant immunity from damages because they can pay for any damages themselves; this is not the case in many developing countries, where the AstraZeneca vaccine will likely be the most common.",1
"This program is only seen in a few high-income countries, and almost in no middle- to low- income countries.",No-fault compensation programs exist where claimants can seek compensation if they receive injuries arising from vaccines recommended by the government.,1
There has not been enough research done on the possible long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,"Without a burden of proof, vaccine rollout should not be suspended. Correlation does not imply causation.",1
There has not been enough research done on the possible long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,There is no plausible way to research the long-term side effects and distribute the vaccines in time to restart society.,1
There has not been enough research done on the possible long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,"These mRNA vaccines do not have access to the nucleus of the cell (where DNA is stored); therefore, they are unable to enter or alter your DNA. Long-term health consequences result from alteration of your DNA over a given period of time. As mRNA vaccines have no ability to alter your DNA, they are subsequently unable to impact your future health.",1
There has not been enough research done on the possible long-term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.,"From a factual- and science-based perspective, these concerns are not legitimate. Just because something is new to the general public does not mean it is unknown; mRNA vaccines have been in development since the late 1980s, and have been tested in humans for rabies, influenza, cytomegalovirus, and Zika.",1
Not all of the vaccines use mRNA.,"These mRNA vaccines do not have access to the nucleus of the cell (where DNA is stored); therefore, they are unable to enter or alter your DNA.

Not all of the vaccines use mRNA.,Less than 8% of all full COVID-19 vaccinations (counting for two-dose vaccines) in the US were non-mRNA vaccines.,1
The US is not the only country in the world. The AstraZeneca vaccine hasn't even been approved there yet; their successes with mRNA vaccines aren't relevant to this discussion.,Less than 8% of all full COVID-19 vaccinations (counting for two-dose vaccines) in the US were non-mRNA vaccines.,1
The US is not the only country in the world. The AstraZeneca vaccine hasn't even been approved there yet; their successes with mRNA vaccines aren't relevant to this discussion.,The AstraZeneca vaccine was primarily funded with the $1 billion given to them by the US government.,1
The US is not the only country in the world. The AstraZeneca vaccine hasn't even been approved there yet; their successes with mRNA vaccines aren't relevant to this discussion.,Approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the US might come at a much later date because the company is weighing asking for full FDA approval instead of emergency approval.,1
