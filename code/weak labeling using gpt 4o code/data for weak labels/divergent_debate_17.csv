The assumption that women need to have the same attitudes as men towards sex in order to be happy invalidates womanhood and feminism.,"The sexual liberation movement does not dictate any particular pattern of behavior.

The dynamics in BDSM relationships are often abusive.,There are many systems and rules in place that people can use to prevent BDSM activities from becoming abusive or dangerous. This can help relationships remain respectful and consensual.,1
Submissives in BDSM relationships give their partners a huge amount of control and power over them. It is easy for this power to be abused.,Any power that a dominant holds is rooted in the giving of power by the submissive. It is not easy to abuse such power since a submissive can revoke it at will.,1
"When a dominant partner goes too far, it can be difficult for the submissive to realize that it is the dominant's fault and not their own for not setting clear boundaries.","People who engage in BDSM are frequently trained to use anti-abusive communication tactics, such as safe words, in order to ensure that boundaries remain clear.",1

Some submissives agree to sex slavery or consensual ownership by their dominant. Such practices are dehumanising and thus abusive.,Submissive partners freely give themselves to their dominant for a number of reasons besides sex. The holistic evaluation of these factors allows them to offer informed consent.,1

BDSM slave contracts are sometimes used to enforce long-term consent between participants. Such contracts remove the right of the slave to withdraw consent for the duration of the contract.,"In BDSM contracts, the submissive partner retains the legal right of last refusal; as such, slave contracts are not legally binding (pp. 178-179).",1
"Some submissive partners wear collars that identify them as submissive and/or owned people. This can be degrading and dehumanising, equivocating submissives with animals.","Collaring ceremonies can be particularly meaningful, denoting the establishment of a committed relationship or other important milestone in a couple's life (p. 3).

"Some submissive partners wear collars that identify them as submissive and/or owned people. This can be degrading and dehumanising, equivocating submissives with animals.",Some people take pride or comfort in being submissive or owned; omitting these experiences in place of presuming victimhood does more harm than good.,1
"Since research has demonstrated that experiences of powerlessness contribute to increased self-dehumanisation (p. 15), any form of slavery or ownership can be considered abusive.",Submissive partners freely give themselves to their dominant for a number of reasons besides sex. The holistic evaluation of these factors allows them to offer informed consent.,1
"Pre-established limits can be broken accidentally, particularly in a community where they are encouraged to be pushed, comparable to building up fitness by gradually increasing a workout.

It is common for people being abused to form a strong emotional connection with their abuser. This does not negate the abuse they suffer.,Any power that a dominant holds is rooted in the giving of power by the submissive. It is not easy to abuse such power since a submissive can revoke it at will.,1
"In some situations, abuse is normalised to such an extent that the abused party cannot feasibly consent; submissives may be unable to revoke their power and regain control of the situation.",Any power that a dominant holds is rooted in the giving of power by the submissive.

Submissives in BDSM relationships may feel unable to revoke consent if that power has been removed from them under the guise of a contract.,Any power that a dominant holds is rooted in the giving of power by the submissive. It is not easy to abuse such power since a submissive can revoke it at will.,1
BDSM practitioners often form strong emotional attachments with their partners (p. 19). This may make it difficult for them to extricate themselves from abusive situations.,BDSM practitioners report extremely low prior involvement in or future intention to carry out coercive sexual behaviours. This may mean that the emotional vulnerability present in BDSM relationships is offset by a low risk of harm.,1

Many are introduced to BDSM by close personal contacts (p. 24). Joining in this manner may make newcomers more vulnerable to emotional manipulation.,"People are more vulnerable to emotional manipulation when they lack community. Therefore, munches and other meet-ups help safeguard against this by making it easy to meet like-minded others (p. 671).",1
"Self-reported intentions are often an inaccurate measure of behaviour, as subjects are keen to be perceived positively. BDSM practitioners may, therefore, be as inclined as vanilla people, if not more so, to be sexually coercive.",BDSM practitioners report extremely low prior involvement in or future intention to carry out coercive sexual behaviours. This may mean that the emotional vulnerability present in BDSM relationships is offset by a low risk of harm.,1
"BDSM practitioners may have a hard time finding partners that share their kinks, and thus be motivated to remain in sub-optimal relationships so that some of their needs are met.",It is no more difficult to leave a harmful BDSM relationship than it is to leave other potentially harmful relationships.,1
"Consensual non-consent (CNC) practices simulate abuse and may appear to be violent, abusive, and/or lacking the consent of one or more parties.",Simulations are not equivalent to actual activities. Simulated abuse is not real and has controls that prevent it from causing harm.,1
"Total power exchange (TPE) relationships use blanket consent, wherein a submissive gives consent in advance of a scene where participants behave as if it has been waived. Such consent cannot be credibly given as participants lack true foreknowledge of the scene ahead.","TPE relationships are generally predicated on a high level of trust developed between participants over a longer period of time, and cannot be accurately appraised outside of this context.",1

"An actor is less likely to be subject to the pressures a BDSM submissive feels when they are bound, due to the protections of actors' unions.","Similar to acting, when BDSM simulates abuse, it does so in a controlled environment where those involved can opt out of scenes or end them at will (p. 1).",1
Simulating nonconsensual sexual behaviour with a partner accurately replicates the experience of transgressing boundaries (p. 64). This may normalise and reinforce such behaviours.,Simulations are not equivalent to actual activities. Simulated abuse is not real and has controls that prevent it from causing harm.,1

"High levels of trust are not inherently present in BDSM relationships; negotiations may be difficult as people struggle to be vulnerable and fully articulate their boundaries. This may facilitate abuse, as people can misunderstand, transgress, or flout another's boundaries.",It is unfair and inaccurate to label an entire practice as abusive based on those who fail to adhere to the correct procedures.

"Since sadomasochistic relationships often revolve around an unending power struggle, the idea of two people becoming closer to each other through sadism and masochism is questionable.","Participating in consensual sadomasochistic scenes increases feelings of connectedness and intimacy between partners (p. 198).

"There is often a disparity between the perspectives of dominants and submissives. If only one partner views BDSM positively, this could indicate that abuse is occurring.","Differences in experience between dominant and submissive roles may be attributable to the greater comfort of dominant personalities with assertive communication; the same power differential exists between more and less assertive personalities in many situations and settings, so the dynamic cannot be attributed to BDSM itself.",1

BDSM practices must be abusive if practitioners need to be pampered to ensure their physical and psychological safety and health.,Aftercare functions as a recalibration for the normalcy of a relationship.

"Consent can be abused or restricted in a number of ways, so it is not adequate protection from the possible harms of BDSM.",Consensual BDSM practices involving physical or mental control are only abusive when the prearranged limits of consent have been breached.,1
A contract can be poorly constructed to give a dominant partner undue control over a scene or relationship.,Many practitioners of BDSM adhere to the principle of risk-aware consensual kink (RACK) to ensure that their actions can feasibly be consented to and are not abusive (p. 3).,1
"Most BDSM practitioners don't enforce formal contracts; even if limits are discussed, most activities in a scene are spontaneous.",Poor adherence to rules does not make BDSM itself abusive; it is those who disregard the rules that are responsible for causing harm.,1
