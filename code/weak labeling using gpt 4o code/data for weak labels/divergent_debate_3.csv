The belief that veganism exacerbates eating disorders is a stereotype which is often perpetuated by disorder treatment centers.,The restrictive nature of a vegan diet may exacerbate eating disorders or trigger those who suffer from them.,1
There is no evidence of a direct causal link between veganism and eating disorders.,The restrictive nature of a vegan diet may exacerbate eating disorders or trigger those who suffer from them.,1
"Minority groups who share ethical eating habits find purpose and orientation, which can help improve their mental health.","Veganism is correlated with an increase in mental health issues (p. 622), which already cost the world US$1 trillion annually.",1
"Many people do not like the idea of animals being killed, yet continue to eat them, exercising cognitive dissonance to avoid thinking about the source of their meat (p. 1). Refraining from eating animals would resolve this (p. 289).","Veganism is correlated with an increase in mental health issues (p. 622), which already cost the world US$1 trillion annually.",1

Refraining from eating animals would resolve this (p. 289).","Veganism may be hard to follow. Failing to maintain a vegan diet is often judged harshly by others, which may produce feelings worse than the cognitive dissonance required for meat-eating.",1
"Since meat remains preserve better in fossils than plant remains, it is difficult to know definitively what human ancestors ate (p. 255).",The development of human brains greatly advanced when meat consumption increased due to cooking.,1
The human gastrointestinal tract is better suited to a plant-based diet.,An omnivorous diet is what allowed humans to develop as they did. Forgoing it may impede future development and evolution.,1
The human gastrointestinal tract is better suited to a plant-based diet.,"Herbivorous gastrointestinal tracts are either multi-chambered or have a comparatively large cecum. The human digestive system is single-chambered with a small cecum, and thus more closely resembles that of omnivores.",1
"A human's digestive tract is most similar to those of monkeys and apes, whose diets consist primarily of plant sources.","While they may have a primarily plant-based diet, many monkeys and apes do also eat meat.",1
"Just because human ancestors behaved in a certain way does not mean that doing so today is healthy. For example, modern humans crave sugar because it was scarce in the past.",An omnivorous diet is what allowed humans to develop as they did. Forgoing it may impede future development and evolution.,1
"The way the human jaw and teeth have evolved makes them ineffective at cutting through meat. Instead, they are optimised for grinding plant-based material.",An omnivorous diet is what allowed humans to develop as they did. Forgoing it may impede future development and evolution.,1
"The way the human jaw and teeth have evolved makes them ineffective at cutting through meat. Instead, they are optimised for grinding plant-based material.","Even if humans did not develop jaws similar to carnivores, this might be because they killed their prey with tools and cooked their meat to make it easier to tear apart.",1
"The way the human jaw and teeth have evolved makes them ineffective at cutting through meat. Instead, they are optimised for grinding plant-based material.","Human teeth are similar to those of other omnivores, proving that humans are biologically designed to eat both meat and plants.",1
"As the number of vegans grows, veganism will become easier and more accessible.",Humans have evolved to be natural omnivores. A global population would likely find it difficult to transition to a vegan lifestyle.,1
"As the number of vegans grows, veganism will become easier and more accessible.","The law of supply and demand states that the higher the demand for a product, the higher the price will become as people challenge each other to get a hold of it.",1
"As demand for vegan food increases, prices will likely decrease as more infrastructure is developed to satisfy that demand.","Despite a recent boom in the industry, vegan products can still cost up to 200% more than comparable animal-based products.",1
Humans are the most adaptable species on the planet. This suggests that adapting the human diet is entirely feasible.,Humans have evolved to be natural omnivores. A global population would likely find it difficult to transition to a vegan lifestyle.,1
Humans are the most adaptable species on the planet. This suggests that adapting the human diet is entirely feasible.,"Memory can be passed down through genes, meaning that vegan behaviours could be passed down to future generations.",1
"When most humans eat animal products, they do not consider the suffering that was required for their meal. If people had to consider the consequences of their diet, far more would be vegan.",Humans have evolved to be natural omnivores. A global population would likely find it difficult to transition to a vegan lifestyle.,1

The existence of prominant vegan organisations and related social media content - that provide easily accessible material and support - has shifted attitudes around how easy it is become vegan.,The preconception many people hold that becoming vegan is hard would likely make the process of becoming vegan more difficult for them.,1
All diets require people to educate themselves about what they eat to ensure they avoid bad nutritional habits. Veganism is no different in that regard.,Being vegan requires a greater amount of nutritional education and is therefore less convenient.,1
"If everyone were vegan, society would have both an increased production of vegan goods (resulting in more affordable produce) and an infrastructure supporting those who found it inconvenient or difficult to find vegan goods.",The vegan diet is not listed as one of the top 40 most popular diets when ranked by convenience.,1
"Due to the mass availability of vegan products and the development of meat substitutes, living a vegan life is easier than ever.",A global shift to veganism is not feasible.,1
