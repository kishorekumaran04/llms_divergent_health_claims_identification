St. Luke's Already Owns 64 Acres of Land,MVHS does not seem to have the technical knowledge or confidence to find space among 64 acres.,1
The St. Luke’s Campus is ideally situated directly adjacent to Utica College’s medical and healthcare programs.,"That area around UC/St. Luke's is very car-centric and likely won't improve much during and after construction, making the proximity almost moot.",1
The proximity will allow for greater connections between the two sides of the road and improve options for UC students to explore around their campus.,Students roaming the hospital area might crowd it and make it a less hospitable environment for patients.,1
If the new hospital is built at St. Luke's environmental impact will be minimized because it will result in an increase of a mere 27 beds.,This isn't necessarily a good thing; a greater bed increase will help the local community in the long run.,1
The Psych center site is in Utica and has plenty of land.,The hospital needs to be in Utica to qualify for the funding.,1
