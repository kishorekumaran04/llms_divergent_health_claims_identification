This would monetarily incentivise obese people to reduce their weight.,"Obese people are already highly incentivised to lose weight, to a degree such that more expensive plane tickets would have little effect.",1
Lessened weight on the plane would also reduce fuel consumption.,"Reducing air plane connection, such as those within national territories, would also reduce fuel consumption.",1
"Lessened fuel consumption reduces the cost per flight, reducing ticket prices.",This could also be achieved by limiting luggage weight.,1
"Doing one does not exclude the other, both can be done simultaneously which makes this a non-true counter.","Reducing air plane connection, such as those within national territories, would also reduce fuel consumption.",1
"This assumes the majority of obese or people at risk of obesity know about such lifespan benefits, which is not the case.",Being obese takes 3-10 years off of one's life expectancy; gaining that many years of life is a powerful incentive.,1
"Obesity is not always a choice, it can be genetic or as a result of mental health problems.","Obese people are already highly incentivised to lose weight, to a degree such that more expensive plane tickets would have little effect.",1
This could be an effective means to reduce air travel demand which is important for climate change mitigation and without viable alternative.,This would be an exclusive and discriminatory way of reducing air travel.,1
It would raise ticket prices for overweight people and thereby disincentivize them to take the plane.,"This would just be insulting and discriminatory for overweight people, since there might be other non-overweight people that pollute much more by taking too many planes.",1
"It would be a highly controversial and to some offensive measure or proposal, likely causing extensive media coverage and debates which would raise public awareness of not just health problems of obesity but also climate impacts of air travel.",The media coverage and the offensiveness of the measures might cause rejection by many people.,1
It can address two problems at once: air travel climate impacts and obesity epidemics.,This would be an exclusive and discriminatory way of reducing air travel.,1
It can address two problems at once: air travel climate impacts and obesity epidemics.,People are unlikely to be sufficiently incentivized to durably and noticeably reduce their excess weight or their air travel merely by subsequent minor changes on price tickets.,1
"It may have a substantial effect indirectly by shaping people's norms, values, and awareness and culture in a broad sense. 'Addressing' a problem does not imply it is 'solving' it.","In such a case, regulations should limit how corporations promote unhealthy habits instead of putting the burden on the citizens.",1
The added focus on weight could contribute to an increase in eating disorders.,People are taxed different rates based on income. This is not different than charging based on weight difference.,1
"It would also incentivise those with a healthy weight to reduce their weight, rewarding unhealthy bodyweights.",People are taxed different rates based on income. This is not different than charging based on weight difference.,1
"It would also incentivise those with a healthy weight to reduce their weight, rewarding unhealthy bodyweights.",It could lead to only reward unhealthy bodyweights if all bodyweight need to be paid for.,1
"A person is a weight burden on the the plane just like luggage, which already requires payment.",Not all bodyweight is a choice.,1
"A person is a weight burden on the the plane just like luggage, which already requires payment.",Making passengers pay according to bodyweight would be an invasion of their privacy.,1
"An incentive is not insensitive to the complexity, it merely yeilds a reward structure for following through with the complexities you bring up.",Stating that reducing obesity could be incentivised by money minimizes the complexity of obesity.,1
