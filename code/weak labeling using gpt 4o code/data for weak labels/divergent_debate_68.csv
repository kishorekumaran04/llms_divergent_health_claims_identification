Wind power displaces fossil-fuelled power stations and thereby reduces greenhouse emissions.,"Wind farms don't supply constant base-load power like fossil-fuel plants do, and so only viably displace a portion of them.",1
Wind farms provide employment for people in rural areas.,The negative effects that wind farms are having on the coal industry is costing jobs.,1
Rural areas often lack sufficient employment opportunities.,"In the EU, there was almost no difference between employment rates in rural areas, cities and towns or suburbs.",1
Wind farms are significantly better for the environment than other means of sourcing energy.,Nuclear energy is much better for the environment than wind energy.,1
Wind farms are significantly better for the environment than other means of sourcing energy.,"Solar farms are better, as they do not need massive construction works.",1
"Nuclear power mining and nuclear plants kills more birds combined, than windmills do. Windmills cause 0.269 avian deaths per GWh, whereas nuclear causes 0.638, as a study from the US shows.",Wind farms disturb bat and bird populations while nuclear powers plant do not.,1
Avian deaths from power generation is insignificant compared to cats and windows.,Wind farms disturb bat and bird populations while nuclear powers plant do not.,1
Every form of obtaining useful energy cause environmental damage. We need to evaluate which causes less damage and will last longer,The construction of wind turbines causes environmental damage.,1
"Wind turbines in use avoid CO2 emissions. Without wind turbines, we would use more fossil fuel and the environmental damage would be much worse.",The construction of wind turbines causes environmental damage.,1
"We shouldn't rely on only one type of energy source, especially ones who rely on climate properties such as sunlight and wind. They should be complementary.","They can be built in many places without strong geographical constraints that wind turbines have (Such as military radars. the protection of bird migrations, or having strong wind requirements).",1
Every form of obtaining useful energy cause environmental damage. We need to evaluate which causes less damage and will last longer,The construction of wind turbines causes environmental damage.,1
"Wind turbines in use avoid CO2 emissions. Without wind turbines, we would use more fossil fuel and the environmental damage would be much worse.",The construction of wind turbines causes environmental damage.,1
"Cities are also rife with noise pollution, yet we build them anyway because they help societies to progress. Wind farms are much the same.",Wind turbines make noise and the noise annoys people.,1
From 100 meters distance a wind turbine can be less noisy than a  combustion vehicle.,Wind turbines make noise and the noise annoys people.,1
Some of the population get positive effects from white noise. Inattentive children focus better in this experiment.,Wind turbines make noise and the noise annoys people.,1
"The appearance of a wind turbine is debatable, but it is important to realize the big picture. Without effective measures of renewable energy, the world as we know it could cease to exist. A small sacrifice in the present could reap greater benefits for the future.","Wind turbines, by their nature and their necessary positioning are conspicuous.  Some people don't like the look of wind turbines.",1
Some people don't like the looks of fossil fuel power plants either. The looks should be less important than the environmental impact.,"Wind turbines, by their nature and their necessary positioning are conspicuous.  Some people don't like the look of wind turbines.",1
"This is just a temporary inconvenience. The benefits of using wind power instead of fossil fuels will last for decades, and outweigh that inconvenience.",The increased use of rural roads during wind farm construction can cause dust problems and wear-and-tear.,1
"Every power generating facility has to be built: coal plants are also build in rural environments. Those fossil fuel plants need infrastructure to get their fuel, increasing dust problems and wear-and-tear.",The increased use of rural roads during wind farm construction can cause dust problems and wear-and-tear.,1
"It is not impossible to compensate for the additional intermittency and uncertainty. In fact, many of the strategies to overcome renewable variability are simple.",Wind turbines suffer from intermittency and are not reliable as a primary power source.,1
