Quantifying behaviour by questionnaire at 12 months old may be too early/imprecise to detect any trends in behaviour.,The PROBIT study referenced found no evidence of improvements to child behaviour or maternal adjustment at age 12 months.,1
"While the PROBIT study referenced does have a large sample size (16491 for the whole year of the study), it wasn't comparing breastfeeders to non-breastfeeders. It studied the effects of encouraging breastfeeding, and the group that was encouraged was only 8.3% more likely to be breastfeeding at the 12 month mark, compared to the control group. Comparing one group to another group with only an 8.3% difference in breastfeeding rates may not be enough to draw strong conclusions.","The benefits of breastfeeding, especially in developed countries, are somewhat overstated. The highest quality studies available show fairly minimal impact.",1

If substitutes like baby formula are not as good for the child then the mother has an obligation to breastfeed so that they get the nutrients they need, in the way that they need them.",Women have a right to choose whether to breastfeed.,1
"Breasts are secondary sexual characteristics (like hair, height, body shape, voice etc.) but not a sex organ since they are not involved in human reproduction.",Breasts should not be exposed in public as they are a sexual organ.,1
"The main function of breasts is to feed a child. The fact that they are sexualized does not make them a sex organ, any more than the mouth or the legs are.",Breasts should not be exposed in public as they are a sexual organ.,1

There can easily be exceptions for women who struggle to breastfeed.,There are reasons why breastfeeding may be difficult for women.,1
