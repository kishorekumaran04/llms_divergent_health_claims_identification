"Outward approval makes us experience a thrill, while disapproval makes us feel low. Attachment to approval is thus like giving everyone a remote control to our satisfaction.","If one unattaches from all outward approval, then they cannot continue to learn this philosophy, which is being presented to them by outside sources. They would likely remain attached to many other things and their unattaching from approval will have been detrimental.",1
"One doesn't have to attach to the approval of the messenger to accept and heed the message (""Watch out!""). Likewise, it is possible to learn without a teacher's approval.

"With any sort of mournful grief or pain of loss, we can dive at the root cause of it - the attachment to what went missing.","Sometime we mourn because another is grieving, and the elimination of our own attachments cannot relieve the grief of the other.",1

"According to the second noble truth in Buddhist philosophy, the source of suffering manifest from desires and ignorance. Desires consist of craving pleasure, material goods, and immortality; none can ever be satisfied. The ignorance aspect causing suffering stems from not being able to see the world as it actual is. This weak and undeveloped mind creates vices such as greed, envy, hate, and anger.",Saying that someone should neither desire nor be ignorant is contradictory. Those who are ignorant and should not remain ignorant must desire knowledge.,1

Desires consist of craving pleasure, material goods, and immortality; none can ever be satisfied. The ignorance aspect causing suffering stems from not being able to see the world as it actual is. This weak and undeveloped mind creates vices such as greed, envy, hate, and anger.","The noble truths in Buddhist philosophy necessarily advocate ego death, the destruction of subjective self-identity, and unpersoning the individual. This, while noble to some, can be also interpreted as cowardice and refusal to experience the ""thrownness"" of one's particular existence.",1
"Ego death is a very good thing and means that you are more in touch with the true nature of the self: Its transience and illusory nature through time. Ego death means reaching enlightenment ... you are confusing destruction of the self with destruction of the personality. ""Ego"" can mean both but the sense of the word ""ego"" being used refers to the self, not to the personality ... so you are equivocating. That is an error on your part. As for ""thrownness"" ... the present moment matters more.","The noble truths in Buddhist philosophy necessarily advocate ego death, the destruction of subjective self-identity, and unpersoning the individual. This, while noble to some, can be also interpreted as cowardice and refusal to experience the ""thrownness"" of one's particular existence.",1
"Mentalization-based therapy argues that the root of mental health issues is in the aggravation of interpersonal relationships, implying that the source of problems are, at heart, attachments.","Mentally ill persons may suffer greatly and even though we would find attachments playing a big role in their suffering, ultimately it is their illness that is the source of their suffering.",1
"Fear is another manifest of an attachment. If we fear death, we are attached to staying alive for instance. If we fear suffering, we're attached to being content, and so on.","Fear of suffering, and attempts to avoid suffering out of fear also cause of a lot of suffering. It is not just our attachments. Man's fear of painful feelings and sensations, fear of scarcity and loss, can all cause him to act in ways that ironically end up hurting himself and others as much or more than the pain being avoided. This can be through greed, addiction, even something passive like apathy to the plight of others.",1
"The attachment of ones ego and youth cause a lot of the pain associated with physical suffering people endure believing their elasticity attached with a younger body has not left them.

""Just like riding a bike""",Many children also face physical suffering as they naturally develop. They dont express attachment to their younger selves though. Children tend to want to grow up.,1
"There is no pain without the experience of pain. ""Physical pain"" isn't painful if you're in a complete coma. Experience of pain requires experience in generalâ€”which requires a conscious mind and a conscious mind can be tempered by being less attached and frustrated by not having what we want. Some cravings are simply harder to temper than others (or perhaps impossible). But an attachment that cannot be detached from is still an attachment ... and still an example of attachment causing suffering.",Physical pain is very common and causes a lot of suffering.,1

"It is the person's attachment to their valuables, their physical health, their dignity or their life that causes suffering. The attacker is merely the force breaking attachments. Thus even though the attacker is the reason for suffering, it is still caused by attachment. One not attached to whatever is being taken would not suffer.","If someone attacks a victim, the attacker is the source of the victim's suffering, not the victim's attachment.",1

There is no perfect picture or stable environment living opportunity for an extended period of time. Suffering is guaranteed for the man who starves just as it is for the man who never stops eating.
