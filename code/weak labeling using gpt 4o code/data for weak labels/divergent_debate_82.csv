"Mandatory vaccination is needed in order to maintain herd immunity, protecting those individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.","High vaccination levels are attained in many countries through information and public engagement campaigns, WHO, and a study commissioned by the EU even found no link between vaccinations being compulsory and vaccination rates. This suggests that making vaccination mandatory is not strictly needed to achieve herd immunity.",1

Many elderly people will be able to avoid sickness.,Elderly people who have adequately vaccinated themselves will not be exposed to any undue risk due to the choice of others preferring not to vaccinate themselves.,1

Thus they rely on herd immunity from others being vaccinated.",Elderly people who have adequately vaccinated themselves will not be exposed to any undue risk due to the choice of others preferring not to vaccinate themselves.,1
More research needs to be done on vaccines for the elderly. A study indicates that evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is lacking.,Elderly people who have adequately vaccinated themselves will not be exposed to any undue risk due to the choice of others preferring not to vaccinate themselves.,1
The above linked source emphasizes that young and healthy people have higher rates of response to the flu shot. Herd immunity cannot be attained by only vaccinating those with compromised immune systems like the elderly. The failure rate in the elderly is the reason for encouraging vaccination in the young healthy population.,"An example of vaccine that does not fully protect against the disease is that against flu, which only cuts the risk of hospitalisation by 30-70% elderly people (not in care homes). This is in part because of the genetic variations in the virus.",1
"The link in the above claim describes the ""largest measles epidemic in North America in the last decade"" as consisting of 725 cases. This is an excellent example of the effectiveness of herd immunity achieved through widespread vaccination.","Even in areas with 97% vaccination rates, outbreaks occur.",1
Failed immunisation is exactly why mass immunization is required to improve protection. If we can reduce the number of vectors (in this case infected people and all the stuff they come in contact with) then we can reduce the number of infections.,Herd immunity might not be attainable even if vaccines are mandated due to intrinsic levels of vaccine non-response (i.e. failed immunisation).,1
"Herd immunity is the slowing or prevention of the spread of disease, due to a prevalence of immunity in a population. It is not an all-or-nothing marker to be ""attained.""

"The primary thesis refers to ""worldwide"" vaccinations. The above source reports the decline in disease mainly in the US, where sanitation/nutrition have improved greatly over the last century. It would be wrong to argue against vaccinating worldwide, just because first-world countries have lower death rates due to their higher standard of living.","Better hygiene and sanitation has caused the decline of diseases, not vaccines.",1
