Fewer people would pass away because they couldn't get a vital organ in time.,"People live and then they die, that is the nature of life. Due to technological advances, bodies can be kept alive almost independent of the vitality inside.

"People living and then dying has been the nature of life so far. There is no moral imperative that demands this to remain so now or in the future, no reason why death should not be postponed even indefinitely. Life expectancy was 26 years in the bronze age.

"Nor should the voices of those who do not support it, if fewer in number, outweight those who support it.
