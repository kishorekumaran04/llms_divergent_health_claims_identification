This makes the assumption that all MSM will be donating and will have been infected with HIV in the previous two weeks.,"The rate of new HIV infections is 44 times higher for men having sex with men than for the general population (www.cdc.gov), while they comprise about 6.8% of the population (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) There is a period of 2 weeks after infection during which the virus is undetectable in blood tests, causing an infection risk to patients. Allowing MSM to give blood would increase patient infection risk by .068*44+(1-.068) = 3.9 times, for only 7% more blood. The risk for patients is disproportionate.",1
