"According to studies, vegetarian diets were associated with a 53% greater risk of depression compared to a diet consumed by non-vegetarians which can lead to worse lifestyles.","The studies are not of sufficient quality to exclude likely confounding, such as mainly that people who tend to be more likely depressive are also more likely to be vegetarian (e.g. having greater ethical concerns, worrying minds, or coming from lower-income countries). Few or no considerable intervention studies are included and the review found contradicting effects.",1
"According to studies, vegetarian diets were associated with a 53% greater risk of depression compared to a diet consumed by non-vegetarians which can lead to worse lifestyles.",The study does not have an explanation for these findings or be due to the particular characteristics of the vegetarian diet (such as diets not including supplementation or being unhealthy) or participants' needs in those studies. No interventional study came to the conclusion that vegetarian diets are linked to greater risk of depression.,1
"According to studies, vegetarian diets were associated with a 53% greater risk of depression compared to a diet consumed by non-vegetarians which can lead to worse lifestyles.","It also found that the studies rated to have the best quality, one study ""associated vegetarian/vegan diets with either no risk or a higher risk of depression (depending on the population) and three studies associated these diets with a lower risk of depression"". These were also much larger than the other studies which found found a negative effect except for the Matta et al. 2018 study of volunteers.",1

"Vegetarians can easily get B12 from eggs and cheese, two foods that are not excluded from a vegetarian diet.","Since plant-foods don't naturally contain B12, vegetarian diets can lead to a type of serious anemia, known as pernicious anemia.",1
"B12 is stored in the liver for up to 5 years and easily supplemented as it's cheap, accessible, and high-dosable.","Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that's almost exclusively found in animal-sourced foods, such as fish, meat, dairy products, and eggs.",1

These findings are merely correlational and do not support the notion that eating a vegetarian diet causes physical or mental health problems.,"Some studies suggest that vegetarians are ""less healthy and have a lower quality of life"" than meat-eaters.",1
The term ultra-processed food is very ill-defined. It is not evident that the consumption of all forms of ultra-processed foods pose a health hazard.,Vegetarianism has been associated with higher consumption of ultra-processed foods.,1
The fact that ultra-processed foods are available doesn't mean that a healthy vegetarian diet is not nutritious in itself.,"With the increase of vegetarian options in the supermarkets, some people may rely heavily on processed vegetarian alternatives which can be high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats.",1
The same argument can be applied to carnivore diets which have a wider range of processed meats high in salt and unhealthy fats.,"With the increase of vegetarian options in the supermarkets, some people may rely heavily on processed vegetarian alternatives which can be high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats.",1

Vegetarian diets provide an abundance of vitamins and minerals which support overall health.,Certain nutrients are present in lower quantities in vegetarian sources or are absorbed less efficiently by the body compared to those in meat or fish.,1
Many vegetarians eat fish and/or supplement these nutrients.,Certain nutrients are present in lower quantities in vegetarian sources or are absorbed less efficiently by the body compared to those in meat or fish.,1
Vegetarian diets tend to be high in dietary fiber which supports a healthy gut microbiome and digestive health.,"Excessive fiber intake can lead to digestive issues for some individuals, such as gas, constipation, IBS or abdominal pain.",1
"While these diets are higher in fiber, they are not excessively high. Nevertheless, high fiber can cause these problems for some individuals but these are relatively few and their bodies usually adapt to it over time.","Excessive fiber intake can lead to digestive issues for some individuals, such as gas, constipation, IBS or abdominal pain.",1

"Meat does not help build muscle mass, instead, specific exercise regimes build muscle mass in conjunction with a suitable protein and energy intake.",Meat does help build muscle mass since it is high in saturated fats which are optimum for muscle growth.,1
Most body builders supplement their protein intake with protein shakes made from powder.,Protein shakes are unnecessary for bodybuilders aiming to build muscle and burn fat. Complete amino acids essential for post-workout recovery are readily available in whole foods.,1
The optimal amount of protein for muscle-building is 1.6 grams per kg bodyweight and in rare cases (e.g. older age and professional) slightly higher. Such amounts are usually not consumable daily with conventional healthy vegetarian diets that don't include protein powders at least during caloric restriction times when they reduce the percentage of bodyfat.,Protein shakes are unnecessary for bodybuilders aiming to build muscle and burn fat. Complete amino acids essential for post-workout recovery are readily available in whole foods.,1

"There are plant-based complete protein sources such as soy, quinoa and hemp seeds.",Achieving nutritional adequacy solely from plant-based complete proteins might necessitate larger servings and a more meticulous dietary approach.,1
Hemp protein is as complete as animal protein and much easier to digest.,"This claim is objectively false. Unlike some animal-based proteins, it is not a complete protein source and has an amino acid score of only 0.64 with lysine as limiting amino acid. Better vegetarian options include combining rice with pea protein for a complete amino acid profile and/or lysine supplements.",1
Grains are often cheaper than animal products.,"Even if these protein sources are complete, these options are relatively limited compared to the broader spectrum of animal-based complete proteins that are more available and cheaper.",1
