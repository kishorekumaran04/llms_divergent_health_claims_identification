For example, the statement 'Community water fluoridation has been a proven method to improve health for over 70 years.' and 'Excess amounts of fluoride ions in drinking water has negative health effects.' are a pair of divergent statements because the former establishes water fluoridation as a safe method to improve public health whereas the latter discourages the use of flourination as excess flouride ions have detrimental health effects. Here is another example: the statements 'Compared to the flu, the death rate for Covid-19 patients was very high.' and 'Higher mortality of Covid-19 could be due to medical constraints created by the sudden influx of patients over a short period of time.' are not a divergent pair of statements because the former compares the mortality of Covid-19 to the flu whereas the latter discusses the possible reasons for the high mortality rate due to Covid-19 virus.
