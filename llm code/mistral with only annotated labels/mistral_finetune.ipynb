Here is another example: the statements 'Compared to the flu, the death rate for Covid-19 patients was very high.' and 'Higher mortality of Covid-19 could be due to medical constraints created by the sudden influx of patients over a short period of time.' are not a divergent pair of statements because the former compares the mortality of Covid-19 to the flu whereas the latter discusses the possible reasons for the high mortality rate due to Covid-19 virus.

These statements present opposing viewpoints on the issue of GM crops and biodiversity.</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe","variable_name":"test_df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-99ea40b4-1583-4f30-809f-9e097ea1a16d\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text1</th>\n","      <th>text2</th>\n","      <th>divergent or not divergent</th>\n","      <th>mistral_output</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>The state should abide by the precautionary pr...</td>\n","      <td>Genetically modified crops can only be grown i...</td>\n","      <td>divergent</td>\n","      <td>&lt;s&gt; [INST]You are given a task to find if the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>While many agricultural practices may be seen ...</td>\n","      <td>Many of the processes employed in genetic modi...</td>\n","      <td>divergent</td>\n","      <td>&lt;s&gt; [INST]You are given a task to find if the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Genetically modified crops can be harmful to t...</td>\n","      <td>Intensive agriculture as a whole, not specific...</td>\n","      <td>divergent</td>\n","      <td>&lt;s&gt; [INST]You are given a task to find if the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Genetically modified crops can be harmful to t...</td>\n","      <td>Genetic modification can be used to prevent ce...</td>\n","      <td>divergent</td>\n","      <td>&lt;s&gt; [INST]You are given a task to find if the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Genetically modified crops can be harmful to t...</td>\n","      <td>GM crops are often modified in ways that can m...</td>\n","      <td>divergent</td>\n","      <td>&lt;s&gt; [INST]You are given a task to find if the ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-99ea40b4-1583-4f30-809f-9e097ea1a16d')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-99ea40b4-1583-4f30-809f-9e097ea1a16d button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
