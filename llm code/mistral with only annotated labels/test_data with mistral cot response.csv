Statement 1: Fear of being publicly shamed for failing to comply would likely outweigh the temporary inconvenience of wearing a mask.
Statement 2: Public shaming does not work as it makes people defensive and thus more stubbornly defiant.
Your final answer should only contain the word 'Divergent' or 'Not Divergent'.[/INST] Based on the provided statements, my analysis is:

Statement 1 suggests that the fear of public shaming can be a strong motivator for people to comply with mask-wearing.
Statement 2 suggests that public shaming does not actually achieve the intended effect of making people more compliant.

Though both statements discuss the concept of public shaming, they provide opposing viewpoints. Statement 1 implies that public shaming is an effective means of enforcing mask-wearing, while Statement 2 contradicts this, stating that public shaming does not work.

Therefore, the answer is: Divergent.</s>",Divergent
