The vaccine against HPV has enormous health benefits and thus protects young girls from becoming sick later on in their lives.,"The claim that the HPV vaccine ""protects young girls from becoming sick later on in their lives"" presumably refers to the manufacturers' marketing claim that the vaccine prevents cervical cancer.

The HPV vaccine also protects against other types of cancer.,"To gain licensure, the HPV vaccine manufacturers were not required to and did not provide studies showing that the vaccine actually reduces the risk of cancer.

"As the link observes, the cervical cancer vaccine targets the two types of HPV responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous lesions.
