Formulation of genetically modified food endangers the lives and health of citizens around the world.,"Many of the processes employed in genetic modification have occurred, in nature and in traditional agriculture, for years without any identifiable health risks. As such, it seems unlikely that GMOs pose a greater risk than non-GMOs.",1
Use of the herbicide glyphosate has dramatically increased since the introduction of GM glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate can be linked to many health problems.,"Glyphosate use is not intrinsically linked to GMOs, thus if it is glyphosate and not GM food that has dangerous side effects, it would be far more logical to ban glyphosate than GMOs.",1
Use of the herbicide glyphosate has dramatically increased since the introduction of GM glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate can be linked to many health problems.,Multiple studies linking glyphosate to numerous health risks have been discredited as unsupported by the available scientific evidence.,1
"The recent rise in celiac disease correlates with the increased use of glyphosate on wheat crops and the presence of gluten proteins. For those with a genetic predisposition, the glyphosate found on genetically modified foods may exacerbate, or trigger the onset of, celiac disease (p. 160).","While the study referenced above touches on possible mechanisms of causation, it neither proves nor investigates the relationship between these mechanisms and the rise in incidence of celiac disease. For example, the study used glyphosate levels that were thousands of times higher than those present in genetically modified foods, the latter of which are too low to alter gut bacteria (p. 1).",1
"Research suggests that glyphosate-based herbicides could be linked to birth defects, cancer, kidney disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",Several external organisations have found major flaws (such as the reliance on animal studies) and evidence of unreported non-carcinogenic findings in the IARC's study that may significantly affect the conclusions drawn.,1
"Research suggests that glyphosate-based herbicides could be linked to birth defects, cancer, kidney disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","In the cited study regarding birth defects, the authors state that the results are preliminary and must be confirmed through additional research (p. 1).",1
"Since glyphosate use seemed to become prevalent only in conjunction with the widespread adoption of GM crops (p. 175), it follows that if GM crops were phased out, glyphosate use would likely be reduced or eradicated along with it.","Glyphosate use is not intrinsically linked to GMOs, thus if it is glyphosate and not GM food that has dangerous side effects, it would be far more logical to ban glyphosate than GMOs.",1
"Since glyphosate use seemed to become prevalent only in conjunction with the widespread adoption of GM crops (p. 175), it follows that if GM crops were phased out, glyphosate use would likely be reduced or eradicated along with it.","There are other key reasons for the global increase in glyphosate that are not entirely linked to the rise of GMOs: its perceived lack of toxicity, relatively low price (p. 175), and its use in the growing practices of both pre-harvest crop desiccation and ripening sugar cane (p. 159).",1
Genetically modified organisms may have irreversibly harmful impacts on the efficacy of vital medicines and treatments due to increased antibiotic resistance.,"Many diseases cause unnecessary health complications and deaths due to a lack of available vaccines (p. 1).

The state should abide by the precautionary principle. Genetically modified crops should not be used unless it is certain that no harmful consequences will be caused by their use.,"Genetically modified crops can only be grown if they are approved for use by the appropriate regional agency, who will only do so if there is scientific evidence that they will not harm the environment or people.",1
The state should abide by the precautionary principle. Genetically modified crops should not be used unless it is certain that no harmful consequences will be caused by their use.,"No one can ever guarantee that the implementation and use of new technologies will be completely risk-free, as demonstrated by the persistent controversy and uncertainty surrounding the widespread use of mobile phones (p. 1). As such, the adoption of the precautionary principle would essentially ban every new form of technology.",1

"The US does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe. The FDA claims that GM foods can be marketed without prior testing because they are GRAS, meaning “generally recognized as safe”.","The FDA's website clearly states that: ""Foods from [genetically modified] plants must meet the same food safety requirements as foods derived from traditionally bred plants.""",1
"Not everything in life is necessarily practical, especially when it comes to food.",The evolution of plants by natural selection does not necessarily result in desirable or practical crops for humans. Their modification has thus been a necessary practice throughout history in order to cultivate ones more suitable for human consumption.,1
"Monoculture cropping leaves large yields of crop vulnerable to the same diseases and blights, carrying the risk of wiping out a massive quantity all at once.","Humanity has been creating and using GMOs throughout history via selective breeding, a form of monoculture. As a result, many species are now significantly different from their wild ancestors in ways that are more beneficial to humans.",1
"Monoculture cropping leaves large yields of crop vulnerable to the same diseases and blights, carrying the risk of wiping out a massive quantity all at once.",Monocultures can be genetically modified to become disease-resistant.,1
"Genetically modified animals sometimes contain genes derived from other species. Though horizontal gene transfer has occurred naturally between different plants, such as sweet potatoes, it has not occurred without human interference in any animal species more complex than invertebrates, such as sea slugs.","Many of the processes employed in genetic modification have occurred, in nature and in traditional agriculture, for years without any identifiable health risks. As such, it seems unlikely that GMOs pose a greater risk than non-GMOs.",1
"While many agricultural practices may be seen as similar to modern-day genetic modification, the former have often been used throughout history, while the latter is a recent phenomenon. With this in mind, the similarities are not enough to conclude that modern GMO foods pose no greater risks than long-established, non-GMO ones.","Many of the processes employed in genetic modification have occurred, in nature and in traditional agriculture, for years without any identifiable health risks.

With this in mind, the similarities are not enough to conclude that modern GMO foods pose no greater risks than long-established, non-GMO ones.","Many 'conventional' agricultural practices, such as mutation or radiation breeding, were only introduced relatively recently or have changed significantly over time, meaning they cannot be seen as less risky to human health by virtue of their longevity.",1
"Atomic gardening, which has been around since the 1950s, involves safely exposing plants to gamma rays in order to genetically alter them. Experts have directly compared its methodology to that of modern-day genetic engineering.","Much of the data from previous gamma garden research and methods is unknown, thus it cannot be cited as proof that genetic modification is safe and acceptable.",1

"Out-crossing or hybridisation can easily occur, whereby a GM crop cross-pollinates with a reproductively compatible non-GMO species. This may lead to reduced biodiversity.",Those conducting genetic modification can carefully monitor and control GM species to prevent this happening.,1
"Pollen can travel large distances and overcome obstacles such as barrier crops, meaning it easily and indiscriminately spreads genes between conventional crops and genetically modified crops. Thus, the process of natural pollination has the potential to eventually render entire species 'genetically modified'.",Crops could be altered so that the pollen produced by the plant doesn't contain the modified gene (p. 268).,1
"There are limitations to all transgene containment strategies, with no method having ever proved itself broadly effective for all crop species.","There are a variety of existing and developing technologies for transgene containment in genetically modified crops and weeds, including maternal inheritance, male sterility, and seed sterility (p. 1).",1

"If genetically modified animals are released into the wild or accidentally escape, they could threaten the continued survival of their wild, non-GM counterparts.","GMOs simply accelerate or generate processes of natural selection and the survival of the fittest, thus there are unlikely to be any unnatural, long-term effects on biodiversity.",1
The accelerated growth rates of some genetically modified fish may mean they could outcompete the wild population for food if released.,The general scientific consensus is that it is not yet clear whether accelerated growth rates of GM fish would increase or reduce their ability to compete with native fish in the wild.,1

Tilling is not a hard requirement for farming non-GMO produce: a number of farms growing non-GMO crops support less mainstream methods of land management that reduce or eliminate the need to till.,"Conventional tilling, needed to keep non-GM crop fields weed-free, strips the soil of many nutrients, increases erosion and run-off, and harms earthworm populations. Herbicide-resistant GMOs reduce the need for this.",1
Traditional cross-breeding is proving to be more successful at adapting crops to drought and poor soils than GM techniques.,Climate change will worsen soil conditions (p. 2-3). GM crops crops can mitigate or adapt to this phenomenon.,1
Farmers can use anaerobic digesters to harvest the methane produced by their livestock so that it can be used as a farm energy source.,"On average per year, cows produce 70kg to 120kg of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.

"Some countries, such as Canada, have voluntary labelling laws, so people don't necessarily know what they are choosing.",People should be able to choose what to buy by voting with their money.,1
"Governments are obligated to protect their citizens. Thus, if GMOs were found to be harmful, governments would have a duty to ban them regardless of public opinion.","For those who do not vote or else vote against a ban, to create a law forbidding GMOs would be a form of harmful paternalism that removes individual bodily autonomy.",1
"Experts are not exempt from bias, and may be funded and/or influenced by industries that profit from genetically modified crops (p. xiv).","While governments should generally heed public opinion, decision making should be driven by expert opinion.",1
"In a democracy, a person's level of education does not make their views more or less valid: it is, rather, which opinion forms the majority that matters.","As income level and education level rise, people are more supportive of GMOs. This suggests that it is specifically the less well-informed and -educated in society who are the main opponents of GMOs.",1
The same could be said of any politician or government.,Public opinion is sometimes misinformed and not supported by factual evidence. It would therefore be imprudent to make legislation banning GMOs based on public opinion.,1

"Demand for GMO-free products is significantly enhanced with the introduction of GMO labels, which negatively impacts GMO producers.","A study found that when some countries switched to mandatory labelling for GM food products, this did not substantially affect consumer behaviour and the purchasing of GM foods did not reduce overall (pp. 112, 116).",1
"In its current form, GMO labelling is not an effective way of informing consumers.","In terms of satisfying both pro- and anti-GMO groups, rules for labeling GMOs, such as those proposed in the US and EU, offer a better solution than an outright ban.",1
"In its current form, GMO labelling is not an effective way of informing consumers.",Making GMO labelling mandatory guarantees transparency so that people can make informed buying choices regardless of their personal views on GMOS.,1
"In the US, a law passed to standardise labelling for genetic modification still allows companies to only provide QR codes or telephone numbers in place of a physical product label, meaning potential information on GM ingredients is not accessible to all.",Digital smart labelling gives customers a much more well-rounded and detailed view of a foodstuff's production process than basic physical GMO labels.,1
"Adding labels to GM products intensifies the misconception that there is something meaningfully different or inherently risky about them, making labels just as poor of a solution for pro-GMO parties as an outright ban.","In Vermont, support for genetically modified foods increased after a labelling law was passed, suggesting that increased transparency through labelling may actually benefit the pro-GMO cause overall.",1
"More than half of EU-member countries requested to opt-out of growing GM crops in their countries, on account of not trusting EU safety assessments. This suggests these EU countries are primarily concerned with public safety.","Countries in the EU have banned the cultivation and importation of most GMOs due to economic protectionism, rather than out of concern for public safety.",1
Laws primarily made to protect a nation economically or politically still protect that nation's population in a variety of ways—the direct impact on public health is not the only source of risk to national safety and security.,There is no guarantee that any universal ban would be enforced in the interests of public protection.,1
"A GMO ban would likely accelerate progress in developing alternative, non-GM techniques that could achieve comparatively better results.",A universal ban is not the right approach to addressing any potential problems with genetically modified foods.,1
"A GMO ban would likely accelerate progress in developing alternative, non-GM techniques that could achieve comparatively better results.","Conventional breeding techniques can take years to produce the desired combination of genes in a species in order to grow new crop varieties. Genetic modification is a much more rapid process, since genes from a wide variety of other species can be directly inserted into the new crop.",1
"Genetic modification is not as quick as its supporters claim, due to limitations inherent to the process, such as unexpected epigenetic changes and/or mutations.","Conventional breeding techniques can take years to produce the desired combination of genes in a species in order to grow new crop varieties.

"Genetic modification is not as quick as its supporters claim, due to limitations inherent to the process, such as unexpected epigenetic changes and/or mutations.",The seemingly slow rate of genetic engineering is offset by the fact that many plant species are being engineered to mature more quickly.,1
"Genetic modification is not as quick as its supporters claim, due to limitations inherent to the process, such as unexpected epigenetic changes and/or mutations.",Epigenetic changes and mutations can occur naturally and thus are not unique to GM organisms.,1
Genetically modified seeds and associated research technologies are patented by a minority of major corporations (p. xix). These patents can be used to financially exploit smaller-scale players in the GMO industry. A blanket ban on GM food would be the surest way to prevent this.,A universal ban is not the right approach to addressing any potential problems with genetically modified foods.,1

"If patented GMO seeds contaminate neighbouring land and grow there, the owners of this land can be sued for patent infringement by Monsanto.","Patents typically expire after 20 years. Since the first GMOs were patented in the early 1990s, some are thus already patent-free and farmers have begun purchasing and replanting generic GMO seeds at much lower prices.",1
"In 1997, Monsanto took legal action against Percy Schmeiser, who had found individual herbicide-resistent canola specimens growing on his own land and then encouraged their propagation.",The actual details of this court case cast doubt over Schmeiser's innocence and do not match the public perception of the incident.,1
Leading scientists have warned that the dependency on large corporations that genetically modified seed patents encourage leaves farmers in developing countries incredibly vulnerable to sudden price hikes or seed withdrawals.,"Some companies offer their products at a reduced cost, or else patent-free, to developing nations. Therefore, it may be plausible that other biotech companies could be persuaded to offer the same with GM crops.",1
Leading scientists have warned that the dependency on large corporations that genetically modified seed patents encourage leaves farmers in developing countries incredibly vulnerable to sudden price hikes or seed withdrawals.,"Farmers would be unlikely to repurchase patented seeds unless they were more cost-effective than the alternative, suggesting that GMO seeds must generally produce better yields and thus make up for the higher cost that repurchasing incurs.",1
Leading scientists have warned that the dependency on large corporations that genetically modified seed patents encourage leaves farmers in developing countries incredibly vulnerable to sudden price hikes or seed withdrawals.,"If this is the case, then abolishing GMO patents or changing the powers they grant their owner could be a solution of equal or greater efficacy.",1
"GM cotton has been widely blamed for an epidemic of suicides among Indian farmers, due to debt problems from high seed and pesticide costs, and failing crops.",The International Food Policy Research institute found that primary data (p. 8) does not support the conclusion that farmer suicides have increased since the introduction of genetically modified cotton.,1
"GM cotton has been widely blamed for an epidemic of suicides among Indian farmers, due to debt problems from high seed and pesticide costs, and failing crops.",The wider context surrounding the plight of Indian farmers suggests it may be inaccurate to blame genetically modified crops alone for high suicide rates among this demographic.,1
"As they are now, patents provide an incentive for companies to continue developing innovative products or services without the fear of proprietary and financial loss. Without this guarantee, the development of GM products is likely to be slowed.","If this is the case, then abolishing GMO patents or changing the powers they grant their owner could be a solution of equal or greater efficacy.",1
"As they are now, patents provide an incentive for companies to continue developing innovative products or services without the fear of proprietary and financial loss. Without this guarantee, the development of GM products is likely to be slowed.","There are other ways to incentivise development that do not involve patents. For example, plant variety rights also protect intellectual property, but with an exemption allowing crop developers to use a protected crop variety in order to develop new, further improved varieties without requiring permission from the original right-holder (p. 6).",1
"As they are now, patents provide an incentive for companies to continue developing innovative products or services without the fear of proprietary and financial loss. Without this guarantee, the development of GM products is likely to be slowed.",Patents can also have adverse effects on innovation.,1
"Patents are in place to provide vital legal rights to the inventors of a new product: to abolish them would leave inventors vulnerable to exploitation. Thus, removing GMO patents would not eradicate exploitative practices in the industry, but shift or widen the group of individuals affected by them.","If this is the case, then abolishing GMO patents or changing the powers they grant their owner could be a solution of equal or greater efficacy.",1
"Like all businesses when faced with government regulation, such companies would be forced to adapt and innovate in order to survive (p. 8).",Some small companies own the patents to GM crops. A universal ban could potentially eliminate the entire company.,1
"Depending on the genetic modifications, under a ban these new products might not be available for sale; it is unlikely that a multinational corporation would invest money in something unprofitable.","Banning the sale of GM crops would not stop financial exploitation: large multinational companies would still be able to patent DNA, complementary DNA, and new plants.",1
