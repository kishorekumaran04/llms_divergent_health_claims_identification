People can still enjoy meat without moral qualms.,The public is unlikely to accept genetically-modified animals.,1
"Many people go vegan for the ethics of animals, not because they do not like eating meat. If these animals did not feel pain, it is likely that some vegans would revert back to eating meat.",Livestock not feeling pain will not justify the other forms of inhumanity associated with eating meat.,1
An Australian survey found that many people (mostly women) go vegan because they do not support animal suffering.,"While the avoidance of animal suffering is the stereotype of veganism, objectively, that is not the most compelling argument for veganism. In order for an alternative to be viable, addressing environmental and health concerns would go a long way for the growing number of vegans, who express alternative reasons for their choices  like their personal health and the environment.",1
Livestock not feeling pain is a step in the right direction towards a more humane world. Progress can be made in the future towards the other injustices after genetically modifying livestock.,Livestock not feeling pain will not justify the other forms of inhumanity associated with eating meat.,1
People would be willing to eat genetically engineered food if it meant they were no longer responsible for suffering and if it did not impose too much of a burden on their lives. link.springer.com,The public is unlikely to accept genetically-modified animals.,1
"Modern factory farming already feeds animals unnatural diets, unnatural hormones in an unnatural environment. Genetic modification, while unnatural, is not too different from current practices.",The public is unlikely to accept genetically-modified animals.,1

"This can be done scientifically, whereas veganism requires a change of public opinion. This is arguably more difficult.","Genetically modifying animals not to feel pain for the purpose of eating them may just as well require a change in morality, which may prove to be more challenging than veganism.",1
"This can be done scientifically, whereas veganism requires a change of public opinion. This is arguably more difficult.","There's a solvency issue with removing pain - it doesn't necessarily reduce the suffering of livestock animals, while more widespread adoption of vegan lifestyles would.",1
Veganism is a choice made by consumers who have less power than suppliers in rapid change to an industry. This is controllable by suppliers regardless of consumer opinion.,The rule is demand and supply. Actually consumers have the power to control the demand and it is up to suppliers to offer what is asked. If one takes a look at recent developments  they will realize that suppliers/businesses have to adopt or lose a lot of money.,1
"Morality is subjective and while vegan's believe suffering is wrong, others do not. This is an objective removal of pain and doesn't rely on morality.","This is only an objective removal of physical pain. If the decision to remove both psychological and physical pain was made, it would make more economical sense to just grow the meat without consciousness, rather than alter the brains of animals.",1
"While it could be argued that veganism is a best case scenario, this does not mean that it is any more likely to be widely adopted. Veganism is not a new approach, whereas this is.","There's a solvency issue with removing pain - it doesn't necessarily reduce the suffering of livestock animals, while more widespread adoption of vegan lifestyles would.",1
"While it could be argued that veganism is a best case scenario, this does not mean that it is any more likely to be widely adopted. Veganism is not a new approach, whereas this is.",Veganism and vegetarianism are not new but both are becoming more common. There's no reason to think this trend will not continue as diet supplements and meat substitutes make a switch easier and campaigning convinces more people.,1
Animals will feel less fear if pain is reduced.,"Fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain. Hypoalgesia is an interruption in painful stimuli that can occur when the body is in the presence of opioids, chemicals produced when in fear. Thus, fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain.",1
Animals will feel less fear if pain is reduced.,Physically feeling less fear will not help the emotional fear experienced by animals going through the slaughter process. This just eliminates the ability to physically respond to such fear.,1
If an organism is modified not to feel pain then Hypoalgesia is irrelevant since the animal isn't feeling pain anyway.,"Fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain. Hypoalgesia is an interruption in painful stimuli that can occur when the body is in the presence of opioids, chemicals produced when in fear. Thus, fear has been shown to be a helpful mechanism in reducing pain.",1
"Animals do not know they are going to die when they enter the slaughter house, no predator is visible, only humans to which the animal is accustomed, emotional fear is minimal.",Physically feeling less fear will not help the emotional fear experienced by animals going through the slaughter process. This just eliminates the ability to physically respond to such fear.,1
Modern slaughter houses are alreadydesigned in such a way to minimize stress on the animal.,Physically feeling less fear will not help the emotional fear experienced by animals going through the slaughter process. This just eliminates the ability to physically respond to such fear.,1

Not enough people are willing to become vegan to completely eliminate the suffering caused by intensive factory farming.,Being ‘willing’ contains elements of societal and cultural norms. Society should promote harm minimisation.,1
58% of online voters at a journal's website indicated they couldn't go vegan.,"The poll is ongoing since November 2017, people can still vote in it.",1
"If livestock no longer feel pain, as proposed in the original claim, this would reduce the number of people who become vegan in order to lessen pain to livestock.","Attitudes on moral issues have historically changed over time.  For example, on the issue of slavery. Two millennia ago, slavery seemed natural, whilst today it seems unthinkable to most people.",1
Animal agriculture farmers and associated jobs will not be lost.,The industry of animal agriculture is frowned upon by many vegans. jobs being lost in this industry would be a good thing.,1
"We don't presently rely on pain as an indicator, instead we explicitly test for the presence of pathogens.","Pain can be a symptom of undetected bacterial or viral infections, disabling the pain response takes away from the early signals of disease and could potentially result in the inadvertant mass consumption of diseased meat products.",1
The industry would not persist with pain-free animals if conditions were seen to be worse than previously.,"Animals experience pain for a reason, and therefore removing it would have negative consequences, leading to a worse outcome for the animals.",1
The industry would not persist with pain-free animals if conditions were seen to be worse than previously.,This would show that pain-free GMO animals are not a viable alternative.,1
Regulations (i.e. minimum space for each specimen or handling manuals) could be made in order to prevent the abuse.,These animals may be handled more roughly and packed more tightly into quarters that would cause a pain-feeling animal distress.,1
"The same metric cannot be applied to animals, as it wouldn't be ethical to slaughter humans for food or to keep them housed in very poor conditions.","CIPA is a rare human genetic disorder in which the afflicted person does not feel pain. It would not be ethically acceptable to abuse or kill a person afflicted with this disorder. Applying the same metric to animals, it would not be ethical to subject an animal that cannot feel pain to abuse or slaughter.",1
The experience of distress as a reaction to pain would actually be reduced in this scenario so a like-for-like classification of 'abuse' could not be made in pain-capable and pain-incapable animals. Abuse would need a different definition for each.,Animals may be subjected to abuse since they are unable to feel pain.,1

Any genetic modification is likely to be done in vitro and therefor unlikely to suffer emotional distress from the process.,Animals may still suffer emotional distress under this process.,1
"Livestock animals do not have those cognitive faculties for anticipation of death. Being domesticated, they do not see humans as predators. Without those instincts the only way to have an emotional fear response is by pain, which has been removed.","The removal of pain does not remove cognitive faculties such as proprioception, anticipation, or the emotional response of fear.
