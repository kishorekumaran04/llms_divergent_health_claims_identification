Healthcare for smoking related illnesses becomes a burden on taxpayers and the insurance market.,"Statistically that may not be the case.

Healthcare for smoking related illnesses becomes a burden on taxpayers and the insurance market.,It only is a burden if the smoker chooses to not have healthcare.  Insurance companies need to be allowed to charge more for people who are shown through general physicals to be less healthy than the average based on poor health decisions (not genetics).

This often results in a long period of suffering, due to pain, degrading conditions, and loss of personal autonomy.

It is therefore logical for one to have the right to choose to terminate his or her life if it ends their suffering and if they are completely aware of their medical condition.,1

Some people argue that there is no dignity in any type of death and thus dignity comes from life itself.,All people should have the right to live a dignified life. That also means having the right to choose death when this kind of life is not possible anymore.,1

Courts have ruled that a right to life does not include a right to die.,"Court judgements are based on current laws, not objective morality. Their rulings should have no basis on if there should be a right to end your life.",1
The European Court of Human Rights has placed limits on the right to life in certain circumstances (p. 6).,The right to life is commonly regarded as an absolute right across the world.,1
The European Court of Human Rights has previously ruled against a right to die by arguing that the state's duty to protect human life is more fundamental than an individual's right to die (p. 1).,"If humans have any rights at all, one of the most basic and fundamental rights should be the right to choose whether to continue living or not.",1
"Since being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, preventing people from dying is the ultimate form of protecting these rights.",It is central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity that each person is able to embrace a timely and dignified death on their own terms.,1
"Since being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, preventing people from dying is the ultimate form of protecting these rights.","If it was true that preventing people from dying is the ultimate way to fulfill rights, then the state would be licensed to violate anyone's rights, as long as doing so saves lives.

"Since being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, preventing people from dying is the ultimate form of protecting these rights.","While being alive is necessary for the existence of autonomy and bodily integrity, it is not sufficient.

Giving people personal autonomy is not necessarily a good thing. Governments currently limit personal autonomy and self-determination in various ways to protect individuals from themselves.,The government should have no say in personal decisions unless those decisions infringe upon the freedoms of others.,1
States enforce various safety regulations like mandatory seat belt or bike helmet laws.,The intrusion on bodily autonomy in these cases is negligible. The fact that states do this does not justify more serious violations of autonomy such as not allowing people to choose to die.,1
The government already tries to prevent self harm in other areas. There is no reason why suicide should be different.,"Self-harm involves causing oneself unnecessary pain without, typically, bringing any benefit. On the other hand, choosing to die can bring an end to suffering and pain.",1
Financial burden should not be regarded as the most important thing when considering someone's life and people should not feel they need to choose to die in order to reduce this burden.,The financial burden that healthcare places on the family of the individual may be reduced.,1
It is not clear that legalising the right to die will mean that people who want to commit suicide will discuss it more with their families or people around them.,"If society and families knew someone was planning on ending their lives, they could provide support and resources which may help that person change their mind, thus reducing suicides.",1
The expectation that they will plan an especially fulfilling or significant death may actually impose additional psychological pressure and stress on individuals.,Being able to make decisions about and plan one's own death can provide psychological comfort.,1
