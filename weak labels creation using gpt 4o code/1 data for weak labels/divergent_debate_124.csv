Religion is arbitrary. What is acceptable by one religion may not be acceptable by another one and only laws made without using religion as it's basis can offer true freedom.,"It depends on the law.  If the law is so restrictive that religions should have to have exemptions to have free practice (which is a true freedom), then your law (as is this one) should not exist.

The power of the individual citizen to influence the law is significantly less than the ability of a monarch, and the organizing power to form a religion that is likely to be recognized by any religious exemption process in modern times would be more difficult.",1
