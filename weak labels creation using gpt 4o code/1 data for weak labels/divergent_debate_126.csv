There are examples of several other western countries utilising the single-payer system with great success.,The Canadian single payer is likely a violation of the Bill of Rights because wait times - which for elective surgeries are on average 7 weeks - are so high that it violates the right to access care.,1
There are examples of several other western countries utilising the single-payer system with great success.,"Since there are many sociological, economic, legal, and medical differences between the US and the UK.

Single-payer health systems are more cost-effective.,"Healthcare is fundamentally a risk venture.
