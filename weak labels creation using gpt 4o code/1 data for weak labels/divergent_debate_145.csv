Children cannot understand the consequences of their parents' decisions about their diet.

Children cannot understand the consequences of their parents' decisions about their diet. Therefore children should not be forced to follow said diet (as they cannot consent).,"Until children are older, it is both necessary and essential for parents to make such decisions on their behalf: children, and even adolescents, cannot competently and consistently make reasoned decisions for themselves (p.19).",1
"The developing autonomy of children should be nurtured and respected rather than dismissed, as to do so aids emotional maturity and stability. Thus, parents should involve their children in decisions about the latter's diet.","Until children are older, it is both necessary and essential for parents to make such decisions on their behalf: children, and even adolescents, cannot competently and consistently make reasoned decisions for themselves (p.19).",1

"The vegan movement is largely based on the idea that to be vegan is to protect animal rights. Human beings are also animals. Depriving an animal of foods they have evolved to eat by nature is a violation of their rights; thus, veganism may be said to abuse human rights in the name of protecting other animals' rights.","As the consumption of animal products carries significant health risks, to deny one's children these products is to care for their health, which seems the opposite of a human rights violation.",1

This is obviously fallacious. We don't have a right to either, but can engage in it if all parties involved consents to it. No non-human animal has given consent to being killed. Therefore, we cannot ethically kill a non-human animal.",1
Evidence suggests that the human body has adapted for digesting both plants and animal products.,That Homo Sapiens evolved as omnivores does not prove that they require meat then or today but rather that they adapted over time to have maximum food options.,1
Evidence suggests that the human body has adapted for digesting both plants and animal products.,"The human body is capable of digesting animal products, but does by no means require it. It is perfectly healthy to eat a plant-based diet.",1

There are considerable health risks for children who follow a vegan diet.,"""It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.""",1
There are considerable health risks for children who follow a vegan diet.,"A certain diet is not abusive if the outcome is that the child thrives. Provided sufficient care is taken, a vegan diet can support normal growth and development of children.",1
There are considerable health risks for children who follow a vegan diet.,"Vegetarian and vegan diets can be healthy, but they can lack certain nutrients. You may have to use a little creativity to ensure you get enough protein, calcium, iron, and vitamin B12. You can find many of these nutrients in eggs and dairy if you're vegetarian, and from plant sources if you're vegan. So, this source from Harvard shows how it is possible to still live a full and healthy life on vegan/vegetarian diets.",1
"A vegan diet may put children at a heightened risk of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential amino acids. This can lead to health complications.",Babies and young children on a vegan diet can get the energy and most of the nutrients they need to grow and develop from a well-planned varied and balanced diet.,1
"A vegan diet may put children at a heightened risk of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential amino acids. This can lead to health complications.","Ruminants grown for meat production often themselves are low in B12, which is then added to feed or injected before slaughter.",1
"A vegan diet may put children at a heightened risk of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential amino acids. This can lead to health complications.","Heme iron, the type found predominantly in blood and muscle, can be absorbed better than the non-heme iron that predominates in plants, but may increase the risk of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome.",1
"A vegan diet may put children at a heightened risk of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, iron, vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential amino acids.

"A study conducted by the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a higher fracture risk in vegans as compared with any other diet, which could suggest that vegan diets make people more susceptible to calcium deficiency.",The European Journal of Clinical Nutrition study was not on children but on adults aged 20-89.,1
"A study conducted by the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a higher fracture risk in vegans as compared with any other diet, which could suggest that vegan diets make people more susceptible to calcium deficiency.","The Journal concluded that the reason for more fractures in vegans could possibly be a lack of calcium, a mineral which aids bone density. However, many plant foods such as kale, broccoli and soy have high levels of easily absorbed calcium. This suggests that the issue may be less the content of a plant-based diet, and more a lack of awareness among vegans surrounding the importance of consuming calcium-rich vegan foods.",1
"There are multiple ways to prevent or treat cobalt deficiency in ruminants before slaughter, thus their meat still likely presents a good source of vitamin B12 for humans.","Ruminants grown for meat production often themselves are low in B12, which is then added to feed or injected before slaughter.",1
"Providing adequate supplementation for a child is extremely difficult for the majority of families. A plant-based diet does not naturally provide everything that a child needs to develop, so parents must add various supplements.",Parents who can't afford to provide their children with a vegan diet are unlikely to force it on them.,1
"Labeling these parents as ""child abusers"" will prevent parents unwilling to do proper research into vegan nutrition from feeding their children vegan diets resulting in undernourishment.",This wrongly assumes that the status quo is an omnivorous diet which is adequately nutritious even without parents having researched how to make it so.,1
