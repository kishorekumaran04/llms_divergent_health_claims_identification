"Vaccines will most effectively bring the pandemic under control, while also minimizing the possibility of a future outbreak of Covid-19.","Vaccine effectiveness is only as strong as vaccine rollout. However, it will be difficult to procure vaccines in suitable amounts.",1
Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to achieve herd immunity.,The concept of 'herd immunity' is considered a flawed approach to tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.,1
Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to achieve herd immunity.,COVID-19 is 99% survivable therefore only high risk people need a vaccine.,1
Vaccinated individuals do not transmit Covid-19 to others.,"While the rate of Covid-19 transmission has been shown to decrease among vaccinated individuals, it still remains possible.",1
This is only true in the case of Covid-19 being allowed to spread naturally among people to infect and confer immunity upon them - vaccinations are a safer route to an end goal (herd immunity) that would be considered a successful outcome.,The concept of 'herd immunity' is considered a flawed approach to tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.,1
"Contracting and recovering from Covid-19 does not confer permanent immunity or protection onto the infected, making a vaccine even more important.",A vaccine will only confer a similar degree of immunity or protection as primary infection itself would.,1
"Contracting and recovering from Covid-19 does not confer permanent immunity or protection onto the infected, making a vaccine even more important.","The vaccine might not be needed for those who have already been sick of COVID-19. If it is proven that previously infected people transmit the virus equally or less than vaccinated people, we might not need to vaccinate those who can prove they've been infected already.",1
There have been instances of reinfection among those who have fully recovered from Covid-19.,There might be other explanations for fully recovered patients testing positive for Covid-19 again.,1
There have been instances of reinfection among those who have fully recovered from Covid-19.,One study found that reinfection rates are less than 1% for those with severe Covid-19 symptoms.,1
"Some studies showed that many Covid-19 recovered patients lost their immunity within, at worst, a few weeks and at best, a few months.",Studies have found that Covid-19 recovered patients usually have immunity for about 8 months and potentially even longer.,1
"Until there is sufficient evidence to prove that immunity lasts more permanently, vaccines remain the safest option.",Studies have found that Covid-19 recovered patients usually have immunity for about 8 months and potentially even longer.,1
"Until this has been confirmed, it is dangerous to pursue a ""third dose"" policy.","According to data obtained from Israel, there are early signs that the protection conferred by vaccines might wane after some time, making people once more susceptible to Covid-19.",1
"Until this has been confirmed, it is dangerous to pursue a ""third dose"" policy.","It is best to be prepared for this outcome, so that action can be taken quickly and decisively if this hypothesis is confirmed.",1

"The immunity conferred by vaccines can be supplemented by booster doses, which can ensure that antibodies persist for longer and have a higher affinity for binding to antigens.",A vaccine will only confer a similar degree of immunity or protection as primary infection itself would.,1
Many experts have argued that vaccination offers significantly more protection against Covid-19 than natural infection.,A vaccine will only confer a similar degree of immunity or protection as primary infection itself would.,1
"These mutations are slow, usually not deleterious, and occur in specific regions of the virus. A vaccine would be specific to the more stable part of the virus.","Early in the pandemic, scientists reported that SARS-CoV-2 was slowly mutating.",1
Vaccine makers are exploring ways in which they can redesign their shots so that people are protected against Covid-19 variants as well.,"SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate. A vaccine made for the current strain will be less effective for subsequent variants of the virus, allowing the pandemic to persist.",1
"A virus' ability to mutate is not a valid reason to stop making a vaccine. Once the base formula is perfected, it can simply be tweaked to adjust to the mutations.","The virus may mutate, making the vaccine redundant.",1
"A virus' ability to mutate is not a valid reason to stop making a vaccine. Once the base formula is perfected, it can simply be tweaked to adjust to the mutations.","Even if those tweaks are made, it doesn't solve supply chain problems that would make it difficult to continuously roll out new vaccines around the world.",1
"The immunity conferred by vaccines can be supplemented by booster doses, which can ensure that antibodies persist for longer and have a higher affinity for binding to antigens.","The virus may mutate, making the vaccine redundant.",1
These breakthrough cases only comprise 0.08% of fully vaccinated people in the US.,Many people who have taken the Covid shot have contracted the virus.,1
"The fact that any “vaccinated” people still contracted the virus is evidence hat it is not a vaccine rather a Covid shot, much like the flu shot. Vaccines prevent infection.",Vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection.,1

"In just six months (by July 2021), over a quarter of the world's population had received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.","The majority of these vaccinations were concentrated in a small number of wealthy countries, where distribution is easier than in developing nations. It is possible that the pace will slow down when attempting to vaccinate places with poorer infrastructure.",1
"This difficulty should not be reason enough to abandon vaccines altogether, but to make an effort to overcome the challenges associated with procurement.","Vaccine effectiveness is only as strong as vaccine rollout. However, it will be difficult to procure vaccines in suitable amounts.",1
Vaccines protect us from diseases by giving us immunity without getting sick.,A vaccine only protects those who are willing to take it from the disease. Many people will not be willing to take a vaccine.,1
Vaccines protect us from diseases by giving us immunity without getting sick.,"A vaccine-induced dependency, even a symbolic one, of humankind on medicine might be detrimental.",1
"By avoiding sickness, a significant number of lives are saved.","The mortality rate for Covid-19 has fallen precipitously as treatment methods have improved. It is possible that we can get the mortality rate even lower over time, reducing the need for vaccines.",1
"If vaccines themselves are shown to reduce mortality rates, it is unethical to pursue a less effective option, as this would unnecessarily prolong the suffering for the victims.","The mortality rate for Covid-19 has fallen precipitously as treatment methods have improved. It is possible that we can get the mortality rate even lower over time, reducing the need for vaccines.",1

Vaccine resistance is rare and measures could be put in place to identify vaccines at risk of failure before they are released.,Vaccine dependence could result in the emergence of vaccine resistant viruses.,1
It is not clear why self-sufficiency is morally superior to taking medicines that greatly reduce human suffering.,Humankind must strive to be self-sufficient.,1
We are currently dependent on vaccines too.,"A vaccine-induced dependency, even a symbolic one, of humankind on medicine might be detrimental.",1
We are currently dependent on vaccines too.,"While many people take vaccines for various diseases, vaccines are not universally administered or depended upon for survival in the same way that people depend on other basic necessities.",1
We have depended on vaccines many times throughout history to reduce or eliminate harmful diseases.,"A vaccine-induced dependency, even a symbolic one, of humankind on medicine might be detrimental.",1
"By more quickly allowing for a return to normal conditions, vaccines would be better for the economy of affected countries.","Because access to vaccines is limited, wealthier countries with greater access will have a head start on their economic recovery, increasing the wealth disparity between nations.",1
A vaccine will allow countries to reduce or eliminate time and resources currently spent on testing and treatment and refocus them on economic recovery and on instituting long-term preventative measures to improve their responses to potential future viral outbreaks.,"It is expected that by 2025, $157 billion will be spent on vaccines alone, meaning that not many resources will be freed up to refocus on economic recovery.",1
