The financial model of the NHS is inherently unsustainable.,Asking people to pay for insurance is no more sustainable than asking them to pay more taxes. Either way the money still has to come from somewhere.,1
The financial model of the NHS is inherently unsustainable.,"The NHS model offers equal access to high-quality healthcare for all UK citizens, funded though public taxation. As such, a growing population should theoretically generate enough tax revenue to cover any surplus costs.",1
The financial model of the NHS is inherently unsustainable.,Figures suggest that the NHS budget has spent a lower percentage of GDP every year since 2010. The NHS was sustainable until the British Government decided to reduce spending.,1
A means tested patient contribution should be introduced. Such a scheme would either eliminate the unnecessary use of the service and/or reduce its wasteful misuse.,It is more prudent to identify the procedural and organizational inefficiencies that are responsible for the misuse of resources than to rearrange the funding model of the NHS.,1
"Generally speaking, publicly funded healthcare systems are incapable of providing sustainable healthcare.","The UK currently only spends around 7% of GDP on one of the best healthcare systems in the world (as ranked by the WHO, UN, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Legatum Institute among others). This is very low and leaves plenty of room for increased funding through current mechanisms such as reprioritization of government spending and increased taxes.",1
"People, theoretically, have an unlimited desire for public healthcare. However, as public funds are limited, the NHS will never be able to cover everything people want.","Whilst valid from a theoretical viewpoint, in practice the NHS is expected to uphold a decent standard of health care, not a service of unlimited quality.",1
"People, theoretically, have an unlimited desire for public healthcare. However, as public funds are limited, the NHS will never be able to cover everything people want.",People are neither immortal nor sick all the time. In this way their desire for healthcare is not unlimited.,1
"People, theoretically, have an unlimited desire for public healthcare. However, as public funds are limited, the NHS will never be able to cover everything people want.",Private funds for healthcare are also limited. The source of the provision does not stop or alleviate the issue of unlimited desire.,1
"People, theoretically, have an unlimited desire for public healthcare. However, as public funds are limited, the NHS will never be able to cover everything people want.","Most countries already provide free and/or universal healthcare, which can include ""total"" health care for all citizens, for free, for their lifetime.",1
"If any healthcare is available free of cost it would be rational for an individual to take every medical treatment possible to keep them fit and healthy forever, no matter how expensive or low efficacy it was.",People are neither immortal nor sick all the time. In this way their desire for healthcare is not unlimited.,1
"With modern life support, you could keep people 'alive' long beyond their usual life expectancy. See also cryogenic freezing for eg. ('why not' everyone if no care for cost)...",People are neither immortal nor sick all the time. In this way their desire for healthcare is not unlimited.,1
Other healthcare models are more sustainable.,"Other financial models have not proven to be any more inherently sustainable than the NHS model. The USA, for example, defers a huge amount of responsibility to the individual but has one of the most expensive healthcare systems in the world.",1
"Hybrid healthcare systems, which feature integrated public and private services, are made more sustainable and efficient by the presence of competition.","Rather than improving patient outcomes, increased privatization may create unrealistic profit motives which are incompatible with the core values of the NHS.",1
"Hybrid healthcare systems, which feature integrated public and private services, are made more sustainable and efficient by the presence of competition.",Several studies suggest that increased competition does not produce a discernable improvement in patient outcomes.,1
"The Australian system works by setting an earning level, which when it is passed you pay for health insurance.",The UK's progressive income tax system already fulfils the fundamental function (ie those that can afford to pay do so) without this added unnecessary complexity.,1
Some of the most financially sustainable healthcare systems in the world (such the Irish system) defer responsibility for financing health insurance to individuals.,"Other financial models have not proven to be any more inherently sustainable than the NHS model. The USA, for example, defers a huge amount of responsibility to the individual but has one of the most expensive healthcare systems in the world.",1
The NHS has cost more every single year since its inception and will continue to do so.,"While the system is currently unbalanced, with a large older generation needing larger levels of support and a smaller generation(s) paying into it, one may reasonably expect that demographic change over the next 20-30 years this will equal this out.",1
The NHS has cost more every single year since its inception and will continue to do so.,"The NHS has, arguably, done more and achieved more with that money including dealing with a bigger population.",1
Brexit may incur more costs for the NHS.,"Every healthcare system in Europe has similar financing problems, due to ageing populations and costly medicines.",1
"The NHS' financial trouble is notoriously endemic and widespread. The National Audit Office has revealed that two-thirds of health trusts in England are now in deficit, while their total debt almost trebled from 2015 to 2016 to £2.45bn.","This argues against the management of the NHS, not the existence of the NHS. The financial troubles can be altered without ending the institution.",1
"Employment-based social health insurance payments can create a more equitable means of ensuring that low-income citizens recieve some form of subsidised healthcare. In this sense, it is both more cost-beneficial and socially responsible.",Asking people to pay for insurance is no more sustainable than asking them to pay more taxes. Either way the money still has to come from somewhere.,1
Changes to national insurance and taxation policies could undercut the potential benefits of a larger taxpaying population.,"The NHS model offers equal access to high-quality healthcare for all UK citizens, funded though public taxation. As such, a growing population should theoretically generate enough tax revenue to cover any surplus costs.",1
"The NHS, by design, is unequipped to manage the prevalent population and health trends in the UK.",The NHS' success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that it is capable of dealing with disproportionate amounts of demand.,1
This is because the population in the UK has increased every single year since the NHS was created. This graph shows the actual NHS budget to be on the ascent every year since 1955.,Figures suggest that the NHS budget has spent a lower percentage of GDP every year since 2010. The NHS was sustainable until the British Government decided to reduce spending.,1
"As older people consume more healthcare, the NHS is likely to face increased demand for its services. This, in turn, logically implies that costs will also increase.",Improving technology brings down the costs of healthcare.,1
"Unhealthy lifestyles are prevalent and treating associated illnesses (i.e. poor diet, diabetes) will be an increasing burden on the NHS.",People in the UK are pursuing healthier diets: a PwC report shows that nearly half of British 18-34 year olds changed their diets in healthy ways from 2015 to 2016.,1
"Unhealthy lifestyles are prevalent and treating associated illnesses (i.e. poor diet, diabetes) will be an increasing burden on the NHS.","That's a comment on the national demographic, not the NHS. It would be cheap (i.e. sustainable) to provide education with respect to leading a healthy life, and introduce policy (often by the way of taxation) to influence decisions e.g. quitting smoking and lowering sugar intakes.",1
The NHS' use of Nightingale hospitals was widely criticized for its financial inefficiency.,The NHS' success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that it is capable of dealing with disproportionate amounts of demand.,1
Waiting lists have signficantly increased as a direct result of the NHS' handling of the pandemic.,The NHS' success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that it is capable of dealing with disproportionate amounts of demand.,1

Indtroducing new technologies across the NHS could be prohibitively expensive.,Old technology slows down progress and is inefficient,1
Indtroducing new technologies across the NHS could be prohibitively expensive.,"Investment is required in order to improve anything. Provided the cost is met by a commensurate return, then the fact that they cost money is irrelevant.",1
"Scientific evidence is lacking to back up this argument. This is particularly true for remote monitoring of chronic conditions, where no beneficial patient outcomes have been recorded.",Digitalisation and new technologies will help the NHS be sustainable.,1
The existing infrastructure of the NHS' digital system is inadequate and thus unsustainable.,Digitalisation and new technologies will help the NHS be sustainable.,1
The existing infrastructure of the NHS' digital system is inadequate and thus unsustainable.,"Being inadequate does not mean it's unsustainable. Your car needing a service or replacement does not mean you give up on the idea of personal transport - you invest in a new car. The NHS can invest in new infrastructure which, if done correctly, could serve it for years and provides benefits to us all far beyond the initial outlay.",1
"The NHS has a poor record of adopting technology outside of front line clinical care. It is still the world's largest purchaser of fax machines, uses 10% of the world's pagers and the NHS Spine project ran for years at a cost of £10 billion without providing a useable system.",The NHS' track record of adopting technology can be changed without giving up on the concept of the NHS.,1
Digital technology is not accessible for the most vulnerable patients.,Digitalisation and new technologies will help the NHS be sustainable.,1
Digital technology is not accessible for the most vulnerable patients.,"Digital technology would not have to be applied to the vulnerable patients. Provided it was targeted at bringing down costs and improving service, it doesn't need to be applicable to patients at all. It could help keep notes or make decisions. It could reduce bureaucratic burden, or ensure that patients' notes are available in an accurate and speedy manner. This would free up cash to ensure the elderly still get 1:1 care and access to more suitable forms of communication.",1
"Many rural areas lack mobile signal, leaving the already-vulnerable patients who live there unable to rely on telephone systems as a means of communication with the NHS.",It would be easy to set up a wifi network for these people.,1
Many of the poorest households do not have reliable wifi/phone access.,High speed broadband has become a legal right for UK citizens.,1
"As a proportion of total budget, the NHS budget is almost twice the military budget and the military budget has been decreasing since the 1980's.","A lot of public money is spent on the military. This funding could instead be ringfenced for healthcare, ensuring the sustainability and viablity of the NHS.",1
Funding the NHS should not place an undue financial burden on other essential social services or public sector interests.,Funding for the NHS could be drawn from other parts of the public sector.,1
"Budgetary reallocations are an insufficient measure to ensure the financial viability of the NHS. Even when operating at peak financial efficiency, the NHS will require an additional investment of £8 billion to maintain its functions.",Budgetary reallocations could solve financing problems.,1
Re-structuring an organisation is not always beneficial and does not always lead to efficiencies,Planned changes such as organisational reconfigurations would help the NHS in this regard.,1
Re-structuring an organisation is not always beneficial and does not always lead to efficiencies,While it is true that restructuring is not a panacea any observer could see that many NHS systems are archaic.,1
Past re-organisations of the NHS have failed to make it more sustainable. See: The history of NHS reform (timeline) from Nuffield Trust and discourse here.,Planned changes such as organisational reconfigurations would help the NHS in this regard.,1
"While more efficient resource management may help to alleviate pressure, this alone is not enough to ensure the sustainability of the NHS.",The NHS can ensure its sustainability by using the resources and funding it recieves with greater efficiency.,1

Reforming its operational model, therefore, is reliant on the consent of the ruling party.","The NHS has demonstrated an ability to restructure its operational model to ensure sustanability when facing political, social, or financial pressures.",1
"Policy decisions regarding the NHS are made by the relevant governmental departments. Reforming its operational model, therefore, is reliant on the consent of the ruling party.","Since its inception, the NHS has consistently recieved strong support from the British public.
