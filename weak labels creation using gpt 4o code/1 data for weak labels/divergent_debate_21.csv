Organically-grown produce tastes better than conventionally-grown.,Taste is entirely subjective and varies per person. Penn and Teller proved this point exactly in one of their shows: Penn and Teller: Organic Food Test,1
"Organic produce is given more time to naturally ripen, producing a better taste.",Produce farmed using non-organic methods cannot be left to 'naturally' ripen.,1
"Organic produce is given more time to naturally ripen, producing a better taste.",No its not. Everything is allowed to ripen as much as it can before going to market to be sold before it goes bad. If something is too ripe when harvested its more likely to be bruised and damaged in transit.,1
Organic farming is better for the environment.,"Organic farming uses more land to grow the same amount of food. More natural ecosystems are converted into farmland this way, which hurts the environment.",1

"If examined as a whole in regards to the global ecosystem, lack of sustainability of conventional farming over time would decrease the persons fed per acre efficiency rating. Eventually, organic farming would overtake conventional farming as the more efficient option. Organic being worse is just seen in the short-term.","If based on persons fed per acre, organic farming is detrimental, due to significant inefficiency",1

"Organically raised animals are not given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts that can contaminate the soil and water via their excrement.","Due to profit incentives, farmers may not treat sick animals, which leads to animal suffering. So there's a cost to preserving the environment: it's at the expense of livestock.",1
"Organically raised animals are not given antibiotics, growth hormones, or fed animal byproducts that can contaminate the soil and water via their excrement.",Organically-raised animals are given antibiotics as a last resort if they become sick. they are just separated from the organic herd. This means their excrement can still contaminate the soil and water.,1

"Seeds imported from big, international companies often are mainly focused on profit, being less resilient than the traditional varieties used by local farmers.",Organic farming can cause famine in the third world where mass crop failures arise from disease and drought.,1
"The opposite is true. Most crops in developing countries are organically produced. It is the flood of cheap, industrial imports that pushes local, organic farmers off the market (1; 2) when the population (and its demand) grows.","Significant population growth in the near future will only make this problem worse, especially in developing countries that cannot afford the expense of organic crops.",1
If a strategy was implemented to teach people in developing countries basic organic farming techniques then it could help develop many local job markets and economic trade structures and would also provide potential export trade goods for those countries to sell.,"Significant population growth in the near future will only make this problem worse, especially in developing countries that cannot afford the expense of organic crops.",1
"Organic crops can be grown without the use of the technologically advanced and expensive machinery that is needed for conventional farming, or the cost of chemical treatments used for pesticides, etc. When seen from this perspective, small scale farming is actually less expensive and much more accessible to developing countries.","Significant population growth in the near future will only make this problem worse, especially in developing countries that cannot afford the expense of organic crops.",1

About 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted and thrown out every year. Yielding less crops is thus more efficient.,Wastage in the food supply chain and the yield of primary production are completely separate issues. The efficiency of production doesn't change with the efficiency of downstream distribution.,1
"A UN report states that small scale organic farming is in fact the best solution to world hunger, as conventional farming ruins the land to the point of starvation.",Organic farming cannot support the current population.,1
"The entire idea of the ""organic"" label is that the food production methods are more holistic than conventional methods. It ridiculous to suggest that just because the definition of ""organic"" can hypothetically be changed (and in the article this argument is based off of, those changes were swiftly rescinded) that guidelines will be weakened to the point of being worse than conventional methods.","If these changes are too great, the organic label regulations might allow organic farming to be worse than conventional methods.",1

GMOs can spread in nature and harm other organisms.,GMO crops are more effective in the face of climate change.,1
GMOs can spread in nature and harm other organisms.,"This is already happening naturally, invasive species are quite common. GM could be used as a tool to actively prevent invasive species and the spread of GMOs themselves. This is actually already an implemented technology and, ironically, anti GMO proponents use as an argument against GMOs:Genetic use restriction technology",1
There are negative health issues affiliated with eating genetically modified foods.,Genetic modifications are not allowed in organic farming.,1
"It shouldn't be, as GMO farming is often only accessible to big farming companies who claim patents of the best GMO seeds and then use those to out.compete smaller farmers. Organic farming allows smaller farmers to stay competitive.",Genetic modifications are not allowed in organic farming.,1
"There are no problems with using GMOs; this is unnecessary, therefore.",Genetic modifications are not allowed in organic farming.,1
