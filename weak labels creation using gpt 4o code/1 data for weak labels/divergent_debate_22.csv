Research in cosmetic surgery is an expensive and unproductive investment.,The financial incentives to innovate cosmetic surgery could help surgeons find new and improved methods for treating people who need plastic surgery.,1
"The money spent on cosmetic surgery research does little to further innovation in other fields, as it has few cross-applicable links.","Even if the research in cosmetic surgery has few cross-applicable links, the costs of such research are justified as long as it helps make the process safer for patients.",1
"Cosmetic surgery does not cure illnesses that limit people's ability to work, making it economically unproductive compared to other treatments.","Low self-esteem affects women's ability to work and causes future unemployment, which results in reduced economic productivity. (p. 337) Thus, cosmetic surgery, to the extent it improves the self-esteem of women, is not unproductive.",1
"If the financial benefits of cosmetic surgery were the only appealing factor, women would rarely opt to become cosmetic surgeons due to the gender wage gap. Given that the financial compensation of general surgeons is almost the same as female cosmetic surgeons, factors other than financial incentives are likely to exist.","People may be drawn to plastic surgery training for the financial benefits of cosmetic surgery; without this, they may opt for other lucrative career opportunities.",1
"Surgeons tend to specialize in a particular field, making it unlikely that cosmetic surgeons would be able to perform non-cosmetic surgeries.",Banning cosmetic surgery will reduce the number of qualified surgeons available to perform non-elective procedures.,1
"Surgeons tend to specialize in a particular field, making it unlikely that cosmetic surgeons would be able to perform non-cosmetic surgeries.","Cosmetic surgeries are increasingly performed by general practitioners, obstetrician-gynecologists, endocrinologists, and other medical specialists, a trend known as ""practice drift"". This demonstrates that these medical practitioners are qualified to perform non-cosmetic surgeries as well.",1
"Many people are drawn to medicine for altruistic reasons, meaning that the supply of qualified doctors will not decrease even if cosmetic surgery is banned.",Banning cosmetic surgery will reduce the number of qualified surgeons available to perform non-elective procedures.,1
Some cosmetic surgeries have to be performed in a hospital operating room. The time allowed for these cosmetic surgeries could reduce the availability of operating rooms for non-elective procedures.,Banning cosmetic surgery will reduce the number of qualified surgeons available to perform non-elective procedures.,1
Some cosmetic surgeries have to be performed in a hospital operating room. The time allowed for these cosmetic surgeries could reduce the availability of operating rooms for non-elective procedures.,"Hospitals triage their resources, which makes it is unlikely that life-saving procedures would be delayed in favor of cosmetic surgeries.",1
"It is possible that women could campaign to exclude breast reduction from cosmetic surgery bans, ensuring their pain does not go untreated.","Breast reduction could be deemed non-essential, as women's pain is often dismissed.",1
"Many countries, including the USA, now recognize breast reduction as a medically justifiable procedure.","Breast reduction could be deemed non-essential, as women's pain is often dismissed.",1
"It is better that transgender people who do not experience gender dysphoria forego surgery, given the considerable risks they face. Bans of cosmetic procedures, thus, do no harm.","Gender affirming surgery for transgender people that do not experience gender dysphoria could be denied, if cosmetic surgery is banned.",1
Cosmetic surgery bans are likely to be conservative due to lobbying pressure from both surgeons and patient advocacy groups.,The distinction between elective and non-elective surgery is thin; bans could harm those whose surgeries are deemed non-essential.,1
Cosmetic surgery bans are likely to be conservative due to lobbying pressure from both surgeons and patient advocacy groups.,"Practical and cultural obstacles limit what patient advocacy groups can reasonably accomplish, at least in the USA. It is therefore unlikely that cosmetic surgery bans will be conservative.",1
"Surgical advancements are driven by research independent of cosmetic surgery. A ban on cosmetic surgery is, thus, likely to have little effect on medical care.",Banning cosmetic surgery would harm the progress and provision of non-cosmetic surgical procedures.,1
"Surgical advancements are driven by research independent of cosmetic surgery. A ban on cosmetic surgery is, thus, likely to have little effect on medical care.","Innovation often occurs from a network effect of great minds working together; reducing the number of surgeons by banning a field of practice could, thus, limit co-operation.",1
"Surgical advancements are driven by research independent of cosmetic surgery. A ban on cosmetic surgery is, thus, likely to have little effect on medical care.","As research funding is limited, it is better to redirect resources to focus on research into non-cosmetic surgical procedures, even if it only helps on the margins.",1
The binary of non-elective versus elective categories of surgical procedures can worsen social inequalities and thus should be avoided.,"Non-elective surgery is beneficial since it is life-saving. By contrast, cosmetic surgery that improves one's appearance offers little utility.",1
"Banning cosmetic surgery could reduce innovation in surgical techniques, as there is less financial incentive to improve upon such techniques.","As research funding is limited, it is better to redirect resources to focus on research into non-cosmetic surgical procedures, even if it only helps on the margins.",1
"Treatment that does harm to the patient in question remains illegitimate, even if there are second order benefits, as the doctor's primary moral obligation is to care for them and do no harm.",Banning cosmetic surgery would harm the progress and provision of non-cosmetic surgical procedures.,1
"Treatment that does harm to the patient in question remains illegitimate, even if there are second order benefits, as the doctor's primary moral obligation is to care for them and do no harm.",Therapeutic surgeries may cause harm to the patients but these are not classified as illegitimate as long as the procedure is reasonable and results only in ephemeral harm.,1
"Cosmetic surgery violates the Hippocratic Oath, as it causes harm without curing or preventing disease, and as such should not be practiced.","Cosmetic procedures, such as rhinoplasty, can be performed with an aim to enhance the patient’s health interests, while keeping the risks of the procedure in mind. If cosmetic surgery is banned, the health interests of such patients will likely be jeopardized.",1
