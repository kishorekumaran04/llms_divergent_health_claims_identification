The fact that other systematic racial issues exist does not mean this particular racist law should not be challenged.,Drug legalisation would not necessarily improve the conditions of those discriminated against: there are still many other forms of systemic racism unrelated to drug prohibition.,1
"Only 8% of American prisoners are in private prisons and many states do not use them at all. Causes of the mass incarceration problem, therefore, go far beyond the influence of private prisons.","The prevalence of racist mass incarceration in the US is in part due to the large influence of private prisons, who profit from - and thus are incentivised to fuel - growing numbers of arrests.",1
"Often, states have had to rely on private prisons to deal with an exploding number of arrests. If significantly fewer people are being charged and arrested for drug crimes in the first place, private prisons may have less influence.","The prevalence of racist mass incarceration in the US is in part due to the large influence of private prisons, who profit from - and thus are incentivised to fuel - growing numbers of arrests.",1
Many other strategies to target the sources of racist policing are often not as popular.

The methods required for policing drugs are often dangerous and invasive.,It is not necessary to end drug prohibition in order to mitigate cruel and dangerous policing practices: adapting the criminal justice system with regards to drug law enforcement would be sufficient.,1
"In the US, police officers use 'no-knock raids' to surprise potentially dangerous drug offenders, which frequently leads to the deaths of innocent civilians.","Since the high-profile killing of innocent civilian Breonna Taylor in a drugs raid in 2020, many US states and districts have introduced or considered proposals to completely or partially ban no-knock warrants.",1
Imprisonment has negative long-term repercussions for individuals.,Time spent in prison can have a lasting positive impact on an offender's life by deterring them from future crime and rehabilitating them via training and well-being programmes.,1
Those who have been to prison find it very hard to find employment upon their release (p. 3).,"More governments and corporations have recognized the stigma surrounding former prison inmates and begun hiring a greater number of them, which at least partially mitigates this issue.",1
Those who have been to prison find it very hard to find employment upon their release (p. 3).,"Some countries have started expunging marijuana convictions from the records of former criminals, making it easier for them to find jobs.",1
"Incarceration often creates, or else fails to treat, substance use disorders or other mental illnesses.","Poor mental health in prison has become a major focus of prison reform, so strategies to mitigate this issue will likely be prioritised when prison policy changes are implemented.",1

"Drug offenses still made up almost 15% of all arrests in the US in 2019, and drug arrests have begun to increase again since 2015.","It is likely that many of those arrests are not solely for drug use or possession but are also for violence or gang activity, which would still be policed under legalisation.",1
"In 2018-19, 59% of all stop-and-searches conducted in the UK were drug-related (p. 34). This indicates that, even while drug arrests have decreased, heavy drug policing is still highly prevalent.","The number of arrests for drug-related crimes are already plateauing or slightly declining in many parts of the world, indicating a less aggressive approach to policing drugs.",1
"The international War on Drugs has led to rich countries, such as the US, inflicting severe harm on less powerful nations and their citizens.","Legalising drugs would simply lead to another form of Western global control, wherein governments and large corporations begin to take ownership of foreign land for drug production.",1
The US-fuelled War on Drugs has had a devastating and deadly impact on Latin American countries (p. 7).,"The US government has given Colombia millions of dollars annually in aid as part of its international anti-drug strategy, with a focus placed on assisting those living in regions particularly affected by drugs (p. 1).",1
"The War on Drugs has often been used as a pretext for the US to gain control over policymaking in other countries, often through corruption and violence.",The most egregious acts committed by the US in the War on Drugs were part of their broader Cold War foreign policy.

"The US continues today to support and implement policies that impoverish communities elsewhere and that cause violence, often committed by government forces.",The most egregious acts committed by the US in the War on Drugs were part of their broader Cold War foreign policy. Those strategies are much less prominent today.,1
Many drugs do not rely on such fields. Amphetamines can be produced in laboratories and plants like marijuana can be grown indoors in a variety of environments.,"Legalisation may lead to a rush for Western corporations to take ownership of the fields where drug crops are grown, giving them increased power over many communities around the world.",1
"Legalisation could help end the drug wars in countries such as Mexico, eliminating the need for US interventions.","Legalising drugs would simply lead to another form of Western global control, wherein governments and large corporations begin to take ownership of foreign land for drug production.",1
"Legalisation could help end the drug wars in countries such as Mexico, eliminating the need for US interventions.",The replacement of drug cartels with legal companies in areas like South America may simply further entrench these countries' roles as drug suppliers for affluent nations.,1
"If it becomes harder to justify street-level policing, this may motivate police to use even more invasive methods to find evidence of illegal drug-dealing.","Under decriminalisation, there would be less need for police officers to monitor street-level drug interactions, which may alleviate a source of great tension between the police and communities.",1
"Under decriminalisation, there often still exist restrictions and thus arrests surrounding the public use and trade of drugs. These mean that problematic policing practices can still continue.",Decriminalisation would likely lead to police targeting poor or minority communities to a much lesser extent.,1
"Under decriminalisation, there often still exist restrictions and thus arrests surrounding the public use and trade of drugs. These mean that problematic policing practices can still continue.","Given that problematic law enforcement is currently such a focal issue in the discussion of drug legalisation, if police continue to abuse their power, further measures may be taken to stop this.",1
"Under decriminalisation, there often still exist restrictions and thus arrests surrounding the public use and trade of drugs. These mean that problematic policing practices can still continue.","Even if police action continues, fewer people will be arrested overall and more of those who do face legal actions will have to face less severe consequences.",1
"Drug-dealing is still a criminal offense under decriminalisation, so police will likely still heavily monitor, and make arrests in, areas where they suspect it is happening.","It may become easier for dealers to circumvent or else abide by persisting laws under decriminalisation, as there will be clear limits on how much one is allowed to possess without facing consequences.",1
"In many countries, there exist limits on publicly consuming alcohol. Even under full legalisation, it is likely that similar restrictions will be applied to drugs.",Public display laws are typically not enforced as heavily when the substance being consumed is legal.,1
"Given the stigma surrounding drugs and the racism that often informs their policing, it is likely that police will enforce these rules more strictly.",Public display laws are typically not enforced as heavily when the substance being consumed is legal.,1
"If police abuse and arrests do not diminish under decriminalisation, it may lead to more support for a return to prohibition. As such, sustainable drug policy reform should legalise all drugs.","Given that problematic law enforcement is currently such a focal issue in the discussion of drug legalisation, if police continue to abuse their power, further measures may be taken to stop this.",1
"Many states would be unable to fund treatment services under a decriminalisation model, given they would not have additional tax revenue from legalised drug commerce.","Most proposals for decriminalisation replace criminal penalties with civil ones that often require users to seek treatment or refer them to support services, which may not automatically happen in a context of complete legalisation. Decriminalisation may thus be more effective than legalisation at reducing problematic drug use.",1
"Many states would be unable to fund treatment services under a decriminalisation model, given they would not have additional tax revenue from legalised drug commerce.","Governments could strike deals with privately-owned facilities, allowing those found in possession of or dealing drugs to access high-quality treatment without the need for significant additional state funding.",1
Non-carceral drug punishment can be incredibly debilitating for people as well.,Such harms could be avoided through decriminalisation rather than through full legalisation.,1
Non-carceral drug punishment can be incredibly debilitating for people as well.,'Defelonization' is merely one possible part of complete decriminalisation. Other methods to help people avoid fines and non-carceral punishments can also be used.,1
Fines for the possession or sale of drugs in decriminalized systems can be between hundreds and thousands of dollars.,The average fine for drug possession is likely to have a more temporarily negative impact on an individual than long-term detention would.,1
Decriminalisation is unlikely to stop many forms of structural discrimination against drug users.,Such harms could be avoided through decriminalisation rather than through full legalisation.,1
Decriminalisation is unlikely to stop many forms of structural discrimination against drug users.,"While structural discrimination against drug users may still exist under decriminalisation, it will be easier for activists to raise awareness of this phenomenon in a context where drug use is not criminally chargeable.",1

Only under legalisation would this not be the case.","While structural discrimination against drug users may still exist under decriminalisation, it will be easier for activists to raise awareness of this phenomenon in a context where drug use is not criminally chargeable.",1
"Under decriminalisation, drug use will likely still be seen as 'taboo' and illegal, meaning drug users will still face prejudice and discrimination. Only under legalisation would this not be the case.","Given the existing stigma, fully legalising drugs may cause backlash, making it harder to address other issues surrounding stigma. Decriminalisation may be a useful incremental step.",1
"While it may not happen immediately, eventually the reduced need to police these areas will become apparent to police as more people buy drugs legally and criminal activity decreases.","Crime and gang activity may initially continue in many areas after legalisation if there is a delay in the drug market shift, so police are likely to continue their current behavior.",1
No type of drug reform will be able to stop racist and aggressive policing. Drug legalisation would simply remove one pernicious avenue through which it is justified.,Legalisation will not change many of the structural reasons for which excessive policing occurs in certain areas.,1
"If drugs were legalised, the drug trade would be less able to fuel serious crime.","There can exist a correlation between an individual's illicit drug use and their likelihood of committing certain crimes. Thus, while legalisation may lead to reduced crime associated with the sourcing and sale of drugs, it may increase crime associated with actual drug use in communities.",1
"If drugs were legalised, the drug trade would be less able to fuel serious crime.","Many criminal organisations are involved in other, non-drug-related industries and thus have multiple sources of income. Changes to the drug trade as a result of legalisation are therefore unlikely to decimate their power.",1
The legalisation of drugs would deprive criminal organisations and gangs of a substantial source of their income.,"If drugs were legalised, large, well-established and legal companies would likely take over their sale and obtain their revenues. These companies could be just as dangerous as criminal ones.",1

The legalisation of drugs would deprive criminal organisations and gangs of a substantial source of their income.,"There will still be a black market demand for drugs in places where they are legalised. Thus, criminals can continue to generate drug-related income regardless.",1
"Around half of the total income of criminal organisations comes from illicit drug trafficking. Without this, they would lose significant power.","If cartels force legal drug companies to buy their drug-farming land, the former may enjoy an influx of money that can be used to invest in other lucrative opportunities. Thus, their criminal behaviour and power may persist regardless.",1
"With less income, these cartels will have less money to bribe politicians and police officers, which would make corruption within these institutions less likely.","Drug-related corruption in law enforcement agencies can sometimes occur with the goal of incriminating known, harmful drug traffickers who have evaded the law (pp. 90-91). In such cases, corruption may help bring down cartels.",1
"Legalization of drugs would have significant economic benefits for the state and its citizens, rather than criminal gangs.","Drug legalisation is not necessary for governments to funnel more money into harm reduction and other social programmes, which could equally combat socioeconomic deprivation.",1
"Drug legalisation would improve national economies and government finances, allowing for more opportunities and investments for all.","Poorer countries would struggle to fund harm reduction, drug treatment, and drug education programmes even if they legalised drugs.",1
"Drug legalisation would improve national economies and government finances, allowing for more opportunities and investments for all.",It is not clear that increased government revenue from legalised drugs would actually lead to more support for those most in need.,1
Drug prohibition consumes a considerable portion of public spending.,"Historically, US public spending on drug prohibition and law enforcement has increased at a significantly slower rate than funding for drug treatment programmes, meaning it is consuming a smaller percentage of overall spending over time.",1
Drug prohibition consumes a considerable portion of public spending.,"In 2021, nearly half of the requested budget for US federal drug control spending went to the treatment of substance use disorders, rather than to enforce the prevention of illicit drug trade and use.",1
"A significant proportion of US drug-related spending going towards harm reduction does not negate the fact that another sizeable proportion does still go to drug law enforcement and incarceration (p. 2). If drugs were legalised, 100% of this money could be funnelled into harm reduction instead.","In 2021, nearly half of the requested budget for US federal drug control spending went to the treatment of substance use disorders, rather than to enforce the prevention of illicit drug trade and use.",1
"The drug industry, like the alcohol and tobacco ones, can be taxed to generate revenue. Some estimates of tax revenue from marijuana legalisation in the US reach $28 billion.",Estimates of tax income from legalisation may be exaggerated.,1
The UK made nearly 10 billion pounds from cigarette VAT from 2020 to 2021. This is an indication that taxes on drugs can raise significant funds.,Estimates of tax income from legalisation may be exaggerated.,1
"If drugs were legalised, fewer productive people would be in jail.","In the case of drug dealers and suppliers, it is likely that - were they not incarcerated - they would still be working as dealers and suppliers, rather than elsewhere in the workforce.",1
"Many drug dealers often have other, legitimate jobs.","In the case of drug dealers and suppliers, it is likely that - were they not incarcerated - they would still be working as dealers and suppliers, rather than elsewhere in the workforce.",1
"If drugs were legalised, working as a full-time dealer or supplier would be much more financially productive for the national economy.","In the case of drug dealers and suppliers, it is likely that - were they not incarcerated - they would still be working as dealers and suppliers, rather than elsewhere in the workforce.",1
"As these countries get richer and their institutions more effective, they will be more able to fund them.",Many poorer countries may not be able to afford such investment as they are unable to enforce tax compliance.,1
Many of the arguments currently surrounding drug legalisation emphasize the potential benefits of the new tax income for communities. Legalisation will therefore likely be accompanied by strong pressure to invest in opportunities and services that cater to community needs.,It is not clear that increased government revenue from legalised drugs would actually lead to more support for those most in need.,1
Many of the arguments currently surrounding drug legalisation emphasize the potential benefits of the new tax income for communities. Legalisation will therefore likely be accompanied by strong pressure to invest in opportunities and services that cater to community needs.,Many governments often fail to represent the interests of their citizens.

"Unlike sellers on the black market, corporations would have a financial incentive not to fuel customer addiction to their drug products.","Legalising all drugs would create a large new market which could be exploited by resourceful drugs companies synthesizing new, highly addictive substances.",1
"Unlike sellers on the black market, corporations would have a financial incentive not to fuel customer addiction to their drug products.","Pharmaceutical companies can make immense short-term profits making addictive drugs. Even if they face financial consequences later, it may still be more lucrative overall to make more addictive products.",1
"Unlike sellers on the black market, corporations would have a financial incentive not to fuel customer addiction to their drug products.","All drugs causing a pleasurable response affect the Ventral-Tegmental Area, a dopamine pathway in the brain which creates pleasure but causes addiction. Any such drug will likely attract more customers than less addictive drugs, so would be more financially lucrative for companies to produce.",1
"Companies would likely build a bad reputation if there were higher addiction rates among their customers, which would deter new customers.","While new customers may be deterred by high addiction rates, existing customers would be more likely to repeatedly purchase from a company that sells the exact substances they are addicted to.",1
"Established companies would be strictly controlled by governments, regulatory institutions and consumers.","If drugs were legalised, large, well-established and legal companies would likely take over their sale and obtain their revenues. These companies could be just as dangerous as criminal ones.",1

"Established entities selling drugs would likely not engage in gun battles on the streets over ""turf"".","If drugs were legalised, large, well-established and legal companies would likely take over their sale and obtain their revenues. These companies could be just as dangerous as criminal ones.",1
"When illegal businesses traffic drugs, it is not only these businesses that make a profit: drugs provide massive black market income for otherwise violent insurgent and terrorist organizations, like ISIS.","If drugs were legalised, large, well-established and legal companies would likely take over their sale and obtain their revenues. These companies could be just as dangerous as criminal ones.",1
"This could still lead to dramatic reductions in the power of cartels, as they would no longer need to control large amounts of land for illegally farming and manufacturing drugs if production were happening in countries where drugs had been legalised.","If drugs were legalised in some countries but not others, criminal organizations could continue generating income by smuggling drugs from countries where they had been legalised to countries where they were still illegal.",1

"Despite alcohol often being very expensive due to heavy taxation, black markets for it are still much rarer in places where it is legally sold.","There will still be a black market demand for drugs in places where they are legalised. Thus, criminals can continue to generate drug-related income regardless.",1
"Despite alcohol often being very expensive due to heavy taxation, black markets for it are still much rarer in places where it is legally sold.","Cheaper black market alcohol is highly popular and accounts for a substantial amount of total alcohol trade in many lower-income countries in Central and Latin America and Africa, despite alcohol being a legally purchasable substance in such countries.",1
"Drug trafficking, fuelled by demand for illegal drugs, is the root cause of much violence and murder committed by criminal organisations, which has the most devastating effect on communities.",The number of total deaths caused by the biological changes that drugs induce is far more significant than the number of deaths caused by their illegal trafficking. This implies that legalising these substances could lead to far more deaths than keeping them illegal would.,1
Criminal organisations often use violence and cruelty as a means of improving their profitability and growing their business.,"With drugs legalised, cartels may have an incentive to use greater violence to sustain profits, for example, by blocking the supply of legal drugs in certain communities.",1

'Drug wars' between rival organisations often lead to many deaths.,"Violence between criminal rivals may increase with the legalisation of drugs, as gangs may use more violence against each other to compete for dwindling power and profits.",1
"There has been a significant decrease in Drug-Trafficking Organisation (DTO) related violent crimes in several US border states that have partially legalised marijuana. This suggests that where demand for illegal drugs decreases, DTO activity also decreases.",Increased violence between gangs tends to be predicted by experts wherever there is reduced demand for illegal drugs.,1

Legalising drugs would facilitate valuable scientific and medical research about them.,The DEA in the US recently streamlined the application process for carrying out research on Schedule I substances to make it easier for scientists to study them. This happened without drug legalisation.,1
"Many illegal drugs such as MDMA, LSD, cannabis, and psilocybin are classed as 'Schedule 1' by the UN, meaning it is highly difficult to receive government approval and funding to legally conduct research on them (p. 31). Legalisation would remove this obstacle.",There often exist structurally similar compounds which are legal that can be researched in lieu of the illegal drug.,1

"Compounds related to illegal drugs may ultimately be banned as well if they are used as substitutes in research, as they would become increasingly associated with the illegal, stigmatised drug they are replacing.",There often exist structurally similar compounds which are legal that can be researched in lieu of the illegal drug.,1
There is no guarantee that a similar compound will always exist for all drugs.,There often exist structurally similar compounds which are legal that can be researched in lieu of the illegal drug.,1
Similar legal compounds may act in different ways than the original drug would. The only way to know if the related compound acts similarly is by doing the research that was banned in the first place.,There often exist structurally similar compounds which are legal that can be researched in lieu of the illegal drug.,1
"Without the added harms from unknown mixing agents and their potential interactions, people will be more informed about the exact risks they are taking when using drugs.",Increasing the quality of drugs will not have a significant effect on their health risks.,1
