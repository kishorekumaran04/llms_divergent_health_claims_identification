"Children are not mature enough to make serious medical decisions, such as delaying puberty.",Understanding of one's gender identity develops at a much earlier age than comprehension of other matters typically addressed at 18 years of age.,1
"Children are not mature enough to make serious medical decisions, such as delaying puberty.",Children are not the only ones involved in these decisions. There are responsible adults (guardians and experts) involved in the process.,1
"The decision-making parts of the brain, notably, the frontal lobes, continue to develop until around 25 years of age.","Adulthood is socially defined in terms of the conferment of rights and responsibilities typically between ages 18 and 21. This age range does not coincide with developmental age of adulthood, namely, 25 years (p. 1).",1
"The decision-making parts of the brain, notably, the frontal lobes, continue to develop until around 25 years of age.","Brain development, inferred based on age, is a poor indicator of decision-making ability. This can lead to the conferment of rights, responsibilities, and powers on incapable individuals and deferment, in the case of capable individuals.",1
"Age restrictions on activities such as driving, consuming alcohol, and getting tattoos are in place because children are considered insufficiently capable of making well-considered decisions.","Cultures differ in whether children are deemed capable of independently providing meaningful medical consent. For example, in some European countries, 14- and 15-year-olds can provide medical consent.",1
The lower limit for the normal pubertal age range is 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys. There is no culture in the world that would consider such young children capable of providing medical consent.,"Cultures differ in whether children are deemed capable of independently providing meaningful medical consent. For example, in some European countries, 14- and 15-year-olds can provide medical consent.",1
"There have been calls to redefine the social age of adulthood as 25 years, in line with emerging scientific evidence on brain development. This would automatically negate any right to delay puberty in those below the age of 25 years.","Adulthood is socially defined in terms of the conferment of rights and responsibilities typically between ages 18 and 21. This age range does not coincide with developmental age of adulthood, namely, 25 years (p. 1).",1
"Adulthood is not solely determined by age or the conferment of rights and responsibilities, as cultural and societal definitions of adulthood vary and can include factors beyond brain development (pp. 2-4).","Adulthood is socially defined in terms of the conferment of rights and responsibilities typically between ages 18 and 21. This age range does not coincide with developmental age of adulthood, namely, 25 years (p. 1).",1
"It is not feasible for governments to individually determine whether a person is, developmentally, an adult. Therefore, they have to use a general age threshold, at which most people are assumed to have achieved specific developmental milestones.","The development of decision-making parts of the brain does not follow a rigid timeline for all individuals, and some may exhibit mature decision-making abilities earlier or later than the suggested age range.",1
"It is not feasible for governments to individually determine whether a person is, developmentally, an adult. Therefore, they have to use a general age threshold, at which most people are assumed to have achieved specific developmental milestones.","In the case of puberty blockers, governments would not need to assess every single child, but only those seeking this intervention, which is less than 1% of the population.",1
"It is not feasible for governments to individually determine whether a person is, developmentally, an adult. Therefore, they have to use a general age threshold, at which most people are assumed to have achieved specific developmental milestones.","Governments individually assess citizens for various purposes, such as determining tax liability and issuing driving licenses. Therefore, the feasibility of individual assessments is not a valid reason to deny gender-affirming care.",1
"Delaying puberty delays the development of associated psychological functions, thereby distorting the utility of chronological age as an indicator of psychological maturity.","At present, there is no evidence to prove that puberty blockers delay brain or psychological development.",1
"Brain development is nurtured by environmental factors, such as nutrition and education. Conferring rights and powers on those with more developed brains may, therefore, perpetuate classism and other forms of discrimination.","Brain development, inferred based on age, is a poor indicator of decision-making ability. This can lead to the conferment of rights, responsibilities, and powers on incapable individuals and deferment, in the case of capable individuals.",1
Children are easily impressionable and can make incorrect decisions.,"While it's always possible for someone to significantly change their gender identity, detransitioning is very rare.",1
Children are easily impressionable and can make incorrect decisions.,"Adults make poor decisions all the time, such as when they opt for a cosmetic surgery they later regret. Yet, this is part of what it means to be human, so children should also be afforded this liberty and learning experience.",1
"Though detransitioning may be rare, there is no way to predict whether a given child will choose to detransition. Therefore, it may be more prudent to eliminate this risk altogether.","While it's always possible for someone to significantly change their gender identity, detransitioning is very rare.",1
"Kallmann syndrome occurs with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 30,000 males and 1 in 120,000 females. Calling on a precedent of a rare disease as a reason to delay natural puberty for anyone is wrong.","Kallmann syndrome is a condition in which puberty is delayed or does not occur altogether. Yet, adults with this condition are not considered to be developmental children.",1
"Gendered puberty plays a significant role in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, which can impact an individual's understanding of their own gender identity (p .1).","Not everyone who is an adult has gone through puberty. Therefore, puberty is neither a necessary nor sufficient criterion for adulthood.",1
"Though not universal, puberty is a significant biological milestone that signals physical maturation and reproductive capacity, aiding the differentiation between children and adults (p. 2).","Not everyone who is an adult has gone through puberty. Therefore, puberty is neither a necessary nor sufficient criterion for adulthood.",1
"Children's understanding of gender roles is likely shaped by the media and adults in their surroundings, which may not accurately reflect the broader diversity of gender roles in society.",Most children start understanding gender roles at around 2 to 3 years of age.,1
"Decision-making is not purely an intellectual exercise, dependent on brain function. Instead, it requires a range of other non-cognitive skills, such as emotional intelligence.",Understanding of one's gender identity develops at a much earlier age than comprehension of other matters typically addressed at 18 years of age.,1
"Decision-making is not purely an intellectual exercise, dependent on brain function. Instead, it requires a range of other non-cognitive skills, such as emotional intelligence.","Emotional intelligence improves with age, possibly due to the maturation of the relevant brain regions and functions. Combined with experience and wisdom, this makes older people better decision-makers.",1
"A child's gender identity will likely change with time, as they are exposed to more gender norms, roles, and expressions as they grow older.",Understanding of one's gender identity develops at a much earlier age than comprehension of other matters typically addressed at 18 years of age.,1
"A child's gender identity will likely change with time, as they are exposed to more gender norms, roles, and expressions as they grow older.",The notion that exposure to different gender norms and roles will change gender identity is misguided. Transgender children demonstrate consistency in the gender with which they identify.,1
"A child's gender identity will likely change with time, as they are exposed to more gender norms, roles, and expressions as they grow older.","Gender identity is a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, and it's generally considered to be a stable aspect of an individual's sense of self.",1
Delaying puberty interferes with the normal trajectory of child and adolescent development.,"Gender identity holds personal significance and contributes to one's personality; thus, granting children the autonomy to make independent choices regarding matters of such importance is crucial.",1
Delaying puberty interferes with the normal trajectory of child and adolescent development.,"In the absence of gender-affirming care, some transgender children and adolescents end up killing themselves. Therefore, there is nothing ""normal"" about a developmental trajectory that pushes a certain group of people to suicide.",1
Children and adolescents go through a process of identity development that includes confusion and experimentation. Delaying puberty may extend this period of confusion by keeping an individual in a state of developmental childhood.,"Confusion in pubertal children is at least partially attributable to hormonal fluctuations. Delaying puberty would, therefore, delay confusion, allowing children to tackle issues related to identity at a later time, when they are psychologically more mature.",1
"Interfering with puberty through medical intervention means that puberty is being treated as a disorder, which it is not.","Analogically, reproduction is paused using birth control pills, yet pregnancy is not considered a disorder. Therefore, there is no reason to think that puberty blockers pathologize puberty.",1
"Interfering with puberty through medical intervention means that puberty is being treated as a disorder, which it is not.","Not all medical interventions are used to treat disorders, as demonstrated by cosmetic surgeries, which merely improve appearance.",1
Not being able to experience puberty like other children may make children with gender dysphoria feel even more isolated or ostracized.,"If a child feels that the social ramifications of not going through puberty outweigh its benefits, they can stop taking puberty blockers at any time.",1
Not being able to experience puberty like other children may make children with gender dysphoria feel even more isolated or ostracized.,Going through gender dysphoria has impacts on mental and physical health that could play a greater role in isolating children.,1
"Delaying puberty may result in physical differences from peers, potentially leading to increased visibility and vulnerability to bullying due to perceived differences.","One in five children experience bullying, yet many still lead normal lives, suggesting that the challenges of bullying may be more manageable than those associated with gender dysphoria.",1
"Puberty marks the beginning of sexual development, which is necessary for reproduction. Long-term use of puberty blockers disrupts this process by causing fertility problems.","There is no evidence to suggest that puberty blockers lead to infertility. Instead, these myths are perpetuated to feed into anti-trans propaganda and conservatist beliefs that regard women as child-bearers.",1
"Puberty marks the beginning of sexual development, which is necessary for reproduction. Long-term use of puberty blockers disrupts this process by causing fertility problems.","Only 1 in 3 gender-diverse children plan to have biological children. Therefore, potential infertility is unlikely to be a deciding factor for many children considering puberty blockers.",1
"It is important to provide guidance and support to children regarding gender identity, as their young age may lead to uninformed or misguided choices that could have long-term consequences.","Gender identity holds personal significance and contributes to one's personality; thus, granting children the autonomy to make independent choices regarding matters of such importance is crucial.",1
"It is important to provide guidance and support to children regarding gender identity, as their young age may lead to uninformed or misguided choices that could have long-term consequences.","Guidance and support may not necessarily lead to better informed decisions. Guidance informed by transphobia, for example, that they are ""just going through a phase"" can be harmful to children who are already distressed about their gender.",1
"Puberty blockers are neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent suicide among transgender children. Instead, non-medical procedures, including social transitioning and accepting social environments, are effective deterrents.","In the absence of gender-affirming care, some transgender children and adolescents end up killing themselves. Therefore, there is nothing ""normal"" about a developmental trajectory that pushes a certain group of people to suicide.",1
"Not going through puberty can harm cisgender boys and girls, as the development of their biological sex characteristics affirms their gender identity.","Not going through puberty has no harmful impact, but going through ""the wrong puberty"" can be detrimental to those with gender dysphoria. Therefore, puberty should be universally delayed.",1
"Not going through puberty can harm cisgender boys and girls, as the development of their biological sex characteristics affirms their gender identity.","Puberty does not guarantee the development of biological sex characteristics. Some post-pubertal girls, for example, may be flat-chested. Therefore, the notion that biology is necessary to affirm gender identity should be discouraged.",1
"To those who are apathetic about their own gender, delaying puberty through the use of medication may be a greater burden on their time, attention, and money, compared to simply allowing puberty to happen.","Some people are gender-apathetic, meaning they are indifferent about their gender. To such individuals, puberty may be a undesired burden on their attention and time.",1
"Gender-neutral parenting would not affirm the gender identity of a transgender child who strongly identifies with a specific gender, especially given that their brain anatomy and functioning are consistent with their desired gender.",Parents are increasingly choosing gender-neutral parenting techniques to mitigate the negative impact of gender stereotyping. Delaying puberty could facilitate such a phenomenon on a wider scale.,1
"Puberty is a period of marked sexual differentiation and, consequently, gender-based discrimination. Therefore, the same benefits of delaying puberty can be more directly achieved by reducing gender inequities.","Delaying puberty may have a curb-cut effect, benefiting more people than just those with gender dysphoria.",1
"Delaying puberty in just transgender children has proven incredibly controversial. Advocating for delayed puberty in all children will prove so much more controversial, making such an option unlikelier for transgender children.","Delaying puberty may have a curb-cut effect, benefiting more people than just those with gender dysphoria.",1
"The yearly cost of puberty blockers is, at best, as expensive as a lifetime supply of period products. Therefore, delaying puberty is not financially wise.","Delaying puberty would be financially prudent for girls and women, thereby helping attenuate the gender pay gap.",1
"The gender pay gap is largely attributed to measurable factors such as educational attainment, occupational segregation, and work experience. Addressing these structural issues is unlikely to be resolved solely by delaying puberty.","Delaying puberty would be financially prudent for girls and women, thereby helping attenuate the gender pay gap.",1
"Cultural biases and social assumptions about women's competence compared to men contribute to the gender pay gap, and these biases are likely to persist even for women who do not menstruate.","Delaying puberty would be financially prudent for girls and women, thereby helping attenuate the gender pay gap.",1
Puberty and menstruation are biological realities for those born female. Girls and women should not have to change their biological functioning in order to be treated equally.,"Puberty hurts girls more than boys, because it marks the beginning of menstruation. Delaying puberty may, therefore, help advance gender equality by leveling the playing field for boys and girls.",1
Puberty and menstruation are biological realities for those born female. Girls and women should not have to change their biological functioning in order to be treated equally.,"The biological reality of periods can be inherently punitive, limiting the performance of girls and women in domains like sports. For this reason, delaying puberty is better than accommodating period-specific needs.",1
"Most people are cisgender, so delaying puberty universally is unjustified.","Puberty should, by default, be delayed, until a person chooses otherwise.",1
"Most people are cisgender, so delaying puberty universally is unjustified.","Mandating a medical intervention is justified, if it protects vulnerable minorities. Mass vaccination of young people against COVID-19, for example, protects vulnerable groups, such as older adults and the immuno-compromised (p. 3).",1
"Most people are cisgender, so delaying puberty universally is unjustified.","Puberty can, by default, be universally delayed, while also providing an option for children to opt out. This will ensure that their biological development is consistent with their gender identity.",1

"Children are not allowed to surgically transition until adulthood, yet that is not considered unethical.",Forcing children to go through a puberty that is incongruent with their gender identity is unethical.,1
"Children are not allowed to surgically transition until adulthood, yet that is not considered unethical.","Puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgery are not comparable, as the latter is permanent. Therefore, it is reasonable to restrict the age of eligibility.",1
"Children are not allowed to surgically transition until adulthood, yet that is not considered unethical.","Cisgender boys with gynaecomastia are allowed to undergo surgical breast tissue removal, so that their appearance matches their gender identity.

"Some puberty blockers, such as Lupron, may cause irreversible bone density loss.",Patients who take Lupron for conditions like endometriosis are prescribed other medication to counteract bone density loss (p. 4). Similar supplements could be prescribed for children taking puberty blockers.,1
"Gender dysphoria does not imply dissatisfaction with every aspect of one's assigned gender or sex. Many transgender men, for example, retain their womb as they would like to give birth and chestfeed their child.","Delaying puberty prevents the development of unwanted secondary sexual characteristics, which would have to be removed in gender dysphoric adults who were denied puberty blockers as children.",1
A transgender woman who has not gone through puberty will not have adequate penile tissue with which a vagina can be created. This can limit their options for bottom surgery.,"Delaying puberty prevents the development of unwanted secondary sexual characteristics, which would have to be removed in gender dysphoric adults who were denied puberty blockers as children.",1
"Gender dysphoria is visible on brain scans. Therefore, in the future, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria may not rely solely or primarily on self-report.","Gender dysphoria screening and diagnosis rely on self-reporting. Those with greater insight into their condition will, therefore, receive a more accurate diagnosis and, consequently, more effective treatment.",1
