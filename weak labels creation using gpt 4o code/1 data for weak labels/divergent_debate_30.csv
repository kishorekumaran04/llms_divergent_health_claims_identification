Conversion therapy can be harmful to young people in particular because they are still developing and may change their sexuality or perceived gender later in life.,"Just because something is dangerous to young people does not mean it should be banned. Rules can be made that prevent people, especially young people, from having conversion therapy.",1
"The American Psychological Association has endorsed sexual identity exploration therapy, aimed at helping religious LGBTQ+ individuals explore a wide range of options, including changing their behaviours without the judgement and cruelty that come with conversion therapy.","It is difficult for religious people to reconcile their non-heterosexuality with their faith, and as such, they might seek conversion therapy to resolve this internal conflict.",1

Conversion therapy often involves cruel or even torturous techniques.,"Banning conversion therapy would not prevent the practice from being carried out. Instead, it would make it even more dangerous.",1
"The foundational philosophy of conversion therapy is itself cruel, as it promotes a negative perception of one's identity.","In many places, conversion therapy is conducted without employing any cruel techniques. Regulation could ensure that these safe forms of conversion therapy are the only legal ones.",1
"Conversion therapists would have to hide their income, which could be difficult and costly.",Most of the methods that conversion therapists use to get around bans are relatively costless and easy.,1

Bans on illegal drugs are justified by the significant harmful effects they have on both individuals and society; conversion therapy has similar deleterious effects.,The fact that a practice can result in harm is not reason enough to ban it.,1
No amount of regulation will change what will necessarily happen in a conversion therapy session.,Regulation of practitioners and accepted procedures allows conversion therapy to exist in a safer manner.,1
No amount of regulation will change what will necessarily happen in a conversion therapy session.,Legal frameworks still give individuals the ability to seek justice against malpractice or fraud if they are manipulated or defrauded as a result of private therapy sessions.,1
No amount of regulation will change what will necessarily happen in a conversion therapy session.,"Forms of therapy, such as electroshock therapy, that are likely to be banned under regulation may be perceived as more effective than safer alternatives.",1
"Conversion therapy is already regulated in countries where it is legal, but it is still harmful. This suggests that there is something inherently harmful about conversion therapy itself, making it hard to regulate out the harms.","In many countries, despite regulations, certain useful but potentially harmful drugs are allowed on the market to be abused. Therefore, similarly, it could be that regulations on conversion therapy would not be effective in selectively restricting the harmful parts of therapy.",1

Government support for anything less than a ban on conversion therapy would be harmful to the LBGTQ+ community.,There is greater precedent for government opposition to conversion therapy than there is support for it.,1
Anti-LGBTQ+ advocates have used conversion therapy as well as accounts of 'ex-gay' people to claim that homosexuality is a mutable characteristic and is therefore undeserving of any legal protection.,"The fact that a characteristic is mutable does not make it undeserving of legal protection.

"If a conversion therapist wants their business to succeed, they need to attract as many people as possible.

Conversion therapy perpetuates the narrative that some identities are wrong and should or can be altered.,"Many conversion therapy practitioners do not act out homophobia; rather, they believe being homosexual can cause harm to people. This is akin to a medical professional not being fatphobic for claiming that obesity is harmful.",1
"By keeping conversion therapy legal, people may view it as something legitimate and therefore believe its underlying claim that LGBTQ+ people should not be accepted as they are.","Keeping conversion therapy legal does not necessarily mean the state opposes LGBTQ people, but merely that it accommodates varying viewpoints and approaches on the matter.",1
There is no known causal link between family circumstances and LGBTQ+ identity.,Practitioners of conversion therapy often identify family circumstances as the reason people identify as LGBTQ+.,1

"Psychological treatments should be based on methods that are scientifically proven to improve people's well-being, not on the personal, unfounded beliefs of certain people.","Conversion therapy is no longer part of the medical mainstream; it is affirmatively a religious practice. Therefore, it is protected by religious freedom.",1
"Considering that some scriptures prescribe the death of homosexuals, there is debate as to to what extent Biblical views on homosexuality should be held valid.",There are several scriptures in the Bible that express God's disapproval of same-sex relationships.,1
No transgender or otherwise queer status is condemned in the Bible. Christians with such a view are imposing modern prejudices upon an ancient belief structure.,There are several scriptures in the Bible that express God's disapproval of same-sex relationships.,1

The same is not true of undergoing conversion therapy.",Many of the most vulnerable people in the LGBTQ+ community cannot leave their communities due to a lack of wealth or opportunities elsewhere.,1
"A person could move, make new friends, and find LGBTQ+ people and allies.

They therefore argue that banning conversion therapy will harm people who have suffered from such experiences.,1
