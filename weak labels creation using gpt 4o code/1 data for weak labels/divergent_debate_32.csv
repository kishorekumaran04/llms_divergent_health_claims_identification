"Without population controls for certain groups, the average IQ of a society will decrease.","High-IQ individuals, particularly high-IQ women, are less likely to have children (pp. 162-164).

Given that intelligence is heritable, higher fertility among low-IQ women could lower the average IQ of a society.","The relationship between IQ and fertility is at least partially attributable to extraneous factors such as education, socioeconomic status, and social mobility. Reducing socioeconomic inequality would, therefore, increase IQ while also controlling fertility without necessitating population control methods.",1
