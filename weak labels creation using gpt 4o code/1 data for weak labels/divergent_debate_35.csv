"If all healthy people got vaccinated, the herd immunity would stop outbreaks of flu (spreading), reducing the threat of contracting the flu for the un-vaccinated.",The flu could mutate in such a manner that renders vaccines far less effective.

Health care providers getting vaccinated will encourage their patients to also get vaccinated.,"The majority of people do not follow their doctor's advice, making it unlikely they will be convinced to get vaccinated based on the example of their health care providers.",1
Research suggests that health care providers will be able to advocate (to their patients) about the value of vaccination in the general public better when they themselves are receiving the vaccine.,"Health care workers are trained especially to be able to connect with patients without themselves having to experience each illness or procedure. Similarly, vaccine education for health care workers could ensure they are able to advocate without the level of intruding on freedoms a mandatory vaccine requires.",1
There is a difference between following medical advice and being affected by the role modelling offered by health-care workers. The influence of vaccination is more likely to be a subtle/ gradual shift in perception that leads to greater vaccine uptake.,"The majority of people do not follow their doctor's advice, making it unlikely they will be convinced to get vaccinated based on the example of their health care providers.",1

"Food service workers don't have a choice(other than quitting their job) about following sanitation procedures in how they prepare food. All kinds of workers don't have a choice about whether to wear the company uniform, show up on time, etc. Their autonomy is limited by their agreement to follow company/industry guidelines when they accept the job. Make this a guideline, meaning people can apply for exceptions, but in the absence of an exception, getting the vaccine will be the ""default"" option.","It is disingenuous to compare a uniform, which one can take off, or a time requirement, to a vaccine which is permanently present in one's body.",1
"The military need an exemption to refuse vaccines, so that they don't get sick and bring new diseases overseas to civilians.",It's worth differentiating between vaccines that prevent infection or lessen hospitalisation and disease effects.,1
The patients that come into health care providers are those most likely to be at serious risk from experiencing serious complications from the flu.,"Protecting those ill/susceptible people when they go to a doctor's visit would be negligible, since those same people go for haircuts, manicures and to the grocery, where they are exposed to the flu as well as many other illnesses.",1
Many high risk patients actively avoid high-risk areas (e.g. public spaces) during flu season given the medical warnings of the heightened risk of contracting the flu.,"Protecting those ill/susceptible people when they go to a doctor's visit would be negligible, since those same people go for haircuts, manicures and to the grocery, where they are exposed to the flu as well as many other illnesses.",1
Medical advice for high risk patients includes avoiding high-risk situations such as shopping centers. The availability of delivery services and online shopping makes this a practical option that many can use to protect their health.,"Protecting those ill/susceptible people when they go to a doctor's visit would be negligible, since those same people go for haircuts, manicures and to the grocery, where they are exposed to the flu as well as many other illnesses.",1
"Healthcare providers are more likely to see people in those vulnerable populations, which could be a risk to those groups if the provider is infected.",Such a risk would be nullified if the vulnerable people in question were vaccinated.,1
It is far more efficient to vaccinate one potential vector for flu transmission than an entire group of potential flu victims. This would free up flu vaccine resources to be used elsewhere.,Such a risk would be nullified if the vulnerable people in question were vaccinated.,1
"The (parent claim) study is a pooled review of three clinical trials, which are all questioned for their unclear methods, as well as lack of compliance in the treatment arm (i.e. the people being studied for efficacy of the flu shot, may not have actually gotten their flu shot.)",The Cochrane Review reports that vaccinating healthcare workers does not reduce hospitalization or death in the nursing home population.,1

"This 2014 study from Clinical Infectious Disease found evidence that immunizing healthcare workers against the flu does have a protective effect in reducing mortality rates of their patients in long-term care facilities and hospitals. The evidence was weaker, for a protective effect on morbidity.","In their own words in the study you mention the authors write: ""The evidence quality for the effect of HCP vaccination on patient hospitalization was low. The overall evidence quality was moderate."" Though the evidence quality was moderate they decide to conclude with making a public health recommendation that ""HCP influenza vaccination can enhance patient safety"".",1
A lack of significant reduction in hospitalization or death in the nursing home population does not mean that vaccination is ineffective. Efficacy could materialise in many ways and still fail to procude significant reductions in the two metrics observed by the study.,The Cochrane Review reports that vaccinating healthcare workers does not reduce hospitalization or death in the nursing home population.,1
Many nursing homes would already have policies in place to ensure workers with flu exposure and symptoms were not in contact with vulnerable residents. This could render the impact of the vaccination on this group particularly hard to measure given existing measures used to protect patients.,"If the infection control measures already in place are sufficient to obliterate the additional impact of mandatory vaccination, then mandatory vaccination would seem to be superfluous",1

"Many jobs have specific requirements or mandates, and all employees must be fit for work. Forklift operators must be certified for safety reasons, divers must have licenses and permits and those working in certain countries must have some vaccines.

"Because the dominant flu strains change each year, the most likely strains to dominate are included in the vaccine for that year.

"Although the vaccine can mistake which strains dominate, the efficacy of the vaccine still ranges from 40-60%, meaning, on average, it halves the risk of contracting the flu.","Due to the constantly changing strains of influenza, the flu vaccine is not as effective as other vaccines as it must constantly be changed.",1
"As the influenza virus is constantly changing, it is hard to develop a natural immunity to it.","Providers might have more opportunity to build up natural, alternative immunity, without needing a vaccine.",1

"The cited article is an op-ed piece in the Huffpost which uses loaded terms to describe the CDC's methods for ""hyping"" the vaccine and ""panicking"" the public. What it describes is basically a public-service campaign by the CDC to encourage vaccination.

"While individuals who cannot take the vaccine because of side effects or other illnesses that makes it impossible, health care providers without such circumstances should feel obligated to vaccinate themselves in order to protect those patients and coworkers that cannot be vaccinated themselves.","In some cases people can have a strong reaction to the vaccine, such as feeling sicker.",1
