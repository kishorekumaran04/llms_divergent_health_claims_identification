GMOs can also yield disappointing crop yields.,This is the Nirvana Fallacy. Just because it isn't a perfect solution doesn't mean we shouldn't consider it as a viable option. GMOs will improve with time and experience to consistently produce superior crop yields.,1
"GMO proliferation reduces natural diversity, which is already at a historic low point due to human activity.","Introducing more species, whether GM or not, increases diversity.",1
"GMOs can create superweeds, that have evolved a resistance to common herbicides, and reduce crop yields.",This is a risk regardless. Weeds will naturally evolve to develop herbicide resistance.,1
"GMOs can create superweeds, that have evolved a resistance to common herbicides, and reduce crop yields.","This discussion is about GMOs, not the use of herbicides.",1
Herbicide resistance is one of the major traits introduced into genetically modified organisms. A discussion about GMOs must thus include some reference to herbicides.,"This discussion is about GMOs, not the use of herbicides.",1
GMO increases corporate hold over food production through their patents.,Patents will expire and the technology behind the patents can benefit food production in general.,1
GMO increases corporate hold over food production through their patents.,Farmers are free to grow whichever crops they see fit.,1
GMO increases corporate hold over food production through their patents.,The problem of patents extends beyond GMOs and should be handled independently.,1
"GMOs have a terminator gene that means the seed can't be reused by farmers. This means farmers need to buy new seed every year, potentially cutting into their profits.",Farmers are free to choose other seeds that have better profitability for them.,1
"GMOs have a terminator gene that means the seed can't be reused by farmers. This means farmers need to buy new seed every year, potentially cutting into their profits.",Termination gene is a way of creating a viable business model. Banning that will cut into profits of the GMO producer.,1
"GMOs have a terminator gene that means the seed can't be reused by farmers. This means farmers need to buy new seed every year, potentially cutting into their profits.",No available GMOs have a terminator gene. Nor have they ever been available.,1
Patenting GMOs will artificially increase the prices.,Patents are used to create differentiated products in the market that have extra value and will sell more. They are not used to drive up prices.,1
Genetically modifying food causes health issues.,"Such changes in DNA will not effect our ability to digest the food. Our body processes basic materials such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids until they are so cut up that the gene sequence does not matter.",1
Genetically modifying food causes health issues.,Genetic material from non-GMO foods and GMO foods are inert in your body and so cannot be processed and added to your genome.,1
Genetically modifying food causes health issues.,There is no real evidence of the harms of Genetically Modified Foods.,1
Genetically modifying food causes health issues.,"The principle behind GM Foods is not too different from that used in other conventional practices, which are not considered harmful.",1
Human populations are ingesting bacterial toxins created by GMO plants.,Our guts host bacterial growth. We are constantly ingesting bacterial 'toxins'.,1
Human populations are ingesting bacterial toxins created by GMO plants.,"This should be an impetus for greater study and understanding. While our bodies process trillions of toxins and viruses and bacteria every day (breathing, drinking, eating, touching) we should minimize it as much as is possible.",1
"Long term impacts, such as an increase in cancer, have been correlated with the use of GM Foods.",Long term impacts have been studied since the 90s and no increase in risk from conventional produce has been highlighted. GM foods are one of the most intensely studied subjects and a scientific consensus has been reached.,1
"Genetic modification, whether through cross-breeding or genetic modification, can create dangerous foods, such as Lenape potatoes. It is best to avoid this risk entirely.","This means that GMO foods should be extensively tested for safety before being sold, just like drugs are, not that GMO foods should be banned.",1
"There are studies that show that it is a distinct possibility that GM foods have detrimental health effects. By the time conclusive evidence for the health harms of GM Foods emerges, it will be far too late to revert the damage done.",There is no real evidence of the harms of Genetically Modified Foods.,1
"They are not doused with ""chemicals"". Also, chemicals are not all the same and they are needed.","GMO crops are not inherently bad. They are still plants. The problem begins when they are doused with chemicals. A chemical ban would be more appropriate, as herbicides are being linked to carcinogenicity. Once again, genetically modifying a plant is not a bad thing. Selective breeding has been around for a long time in order to create stronger characteristics in plants. Chemicals are the problem.",1
"""Genetic modification"" in this context has a specific definition. It is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology. Selective breeding is not the same as genetic modification.","Cross-breeding plants by grafting or other methods is genetically modifying them. The difference is what degree of control over exact results we have. Genetically Modified has become a fear phrase and public education and more scientific study is needed, not bans.",1
You only need to harvest the rennet culture once. Therefore there is very little impact on animals from traditional rennet.,"Roughly 90% of cheese in the USA is made from fermentation produced chymosin, which is a thickening agent and created using GM e-coli. Before that innovation, cheese was made using rennet, which is the stomach lining of unweaned calves and a biproduct of the veal industry. Returning to this source of chymosin would increase cruelty to animals and substantially increase the cost of cheese.",1
"Farmers are paid less money than they otherwise would be, making it less possible for them to live off their earnings.",Genetic modification means less money is being spent on producing food.,1
"Making choices of what to eat can have implications for other rights, which may be more important. In particular, if cultivating GMO crops causes environmental hazards, there would be a trade-off between the risk to society and individual choice. If the hazard was sufficiently large, that would justify restricting choice.",People should have the right to choose what they eat. The government should never ban any food items.,1
"That is not a principle that our society seems willing to adopt. Taken literally, this would mean that there are no restrictions or regulations of any drugs or many other things.",People should have the right to choose what they eat. The government should never ban any food items.,1
"This is not universally true; for example, the consumption of human flesh is illegal.",People should have the right to choose what they eat. The government should never ban any food items.,1
There are no significant environmental benefits of reduced tilling.,"GM produce requires less tilling to remove weeds, thus protecting the soil.",1
There are no significant environmental benefits of reduced tilling.,There are more benefits of GM crops than just tilling.,1
There are no significant environmental benefits of reduced tilling.,"A systematic review of the practice suggests otherwise. ""Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions.""",1
Biomimicry design principles in sustainable agriculture systems (for example Permaculture or Aquaponics) need less tilling than any mono-culture practices.,"GM produce requires less tilling to remove weeds, thus protecting the soil.",1
"The claim that GMO crops need less tilling is not true because there are methods to not till at all i.e. no-till farming. For example, organic management practice often rely on the use of normal, non-dyed corrugated cardboard for use on seed-beds and vegetable areas.","GM produce requires less tilling to remove weeds, thus protecting the soil.",1
