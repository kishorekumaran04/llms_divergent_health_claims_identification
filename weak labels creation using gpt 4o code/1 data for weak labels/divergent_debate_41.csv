The level of physical toll and risk of injury that is currently expected/ required of athletes to reach the top performance standards means that sport itself can be unsafe.,Steroid use threatens athletes' health.,1
The level of physical toll and risk of injury that is currently expected/ required of athletes to reach the top performance standards means that sport itself can be unsafe.,"Sports organisations and governments put forward policies to protect athletes from the worst risks of sport based on their current information, e.g. the protocol changes that followed the exposure of concussion risk in the NFL. Legalising PEDs would be a step in the opposite direction.",1
"Steroid use could be monitored and regulated, so athletes don't use lethal amounts.",Steroid use threatens athletes' health.,1
Steroid use will happen regardless of whether or not it is legal.,"This is an argument against literally any kind of regulation. Presumably the penalties have at least a marginal impact, which means the question must be whether that marginal reduction is worth it.",1
Steroid use will happen regardless of whether or not it is legal.,"Steroid use will only occur when the benefits of doping outweigh the risks, increasing penalties for doping (and increasing screening) could drastically reduce its occurrence.",1
Legalising the use of PEDs will create transparency and allow regulation of the market.,"Regulation companies wouldn't be able to catch up with the newer, more advanced drugs being created.",1
"There would be very little incentive for athletes to lie, since steroid use would be legal.","Even if steroids are legal, many of the same incentives (e.g. to get ahead of other competitors, to keep their advantage secret) could drive athletes to not disclose, or lie about, which steroids they are using, despite them being legal.",1
If steroids were legal and widely used it is unlikely there would be any stigma against their use.,Another motivation for athletes to lie about steroid use would be to maintain a 'clean' public image.,1
If steroids were legal and widely used it is unlikely there would be any stigma against their use.,"Although it is possible attitudes would change over time, steroid use is currently associated with lying, cheating and athletes who have been stripped of awards. That stigma would survive even if steroids became legal (and permissible within the rules of sporting tournaments).",1
"If athletes are being coerced currently, it is grossly unfair that the status quo imposes harsh, individual punishments such as bans.",Coaches and clubs already coerce their athletes into taking PEDs. This would only get worse in a world where there were no consequences.,1
Legalising steroids will allow for the regulation of steroids to ensure their safety.,Many common steroids used for doping are approved by the FDA and other agencies for medical purposes.,1
In order to escape detection during drug tests many athletes use designer steroids. These are novel compounds that have not been tested by any agency for safety in medical or non-medical uses.,Many common steroids used for doping are approved by the FDA and other agencies for medical purposes.,1
"If steroid use is legal, players will be able to seek medical advice and supervision when using steroids.","Even though illegal, most doping regimens are done under the supervision of a doctor.",1
"As with other team support staff, doctors would likely work under non-disclosure agreements and non-compete clauses, making collaboration across teams challenging.","Having doctors tasked with monitoring doping, and able to operate in a legal capacity, would allow them to collaborate openly with other doctors to find safe approaches to steroid use.",1
"Even when used under medical supervision, the use of PEDs carries serious health risks.","Even though illegal, most doping regimens are done under the supervision of a doctor.",1
Steroids are used by athletes at doses that are 10-100 times higher than the recommended doses for prescription medical use.,"Even though illegal, most doping regimens are done under the supervision of a doctor.",1
"Currently athletes who are exceptional are often suspected of steroid use, even if they are passing drug tests. Their achievements are being undermined and discredited by rumour and suspicion surrounding steroid use.",The current culture condemning PEDs means that legalization will not undermine people's tendency to discredit the accomplishments of suspected dopers.,1
"When steroids are illegal, those who use them gain an unfair advantage. Legalisation evens this playing field by allowing all athletes to use steroids.","Steroid use will only occur when the benefits of doping outweigh the risks, increasing penalties for doping (and increasing screening) could drastically reduce its occurrence.",1
"Currently, athletes who are unwilling to break the rules are at a disadvantage. We shouldn't punish people for acting ethically.","Steroid use will only occur when the benefits of doping outweigh the risks, increasing penalties for doping (and increasing screening) could drastically reduce its occurrence.",1
"Many PEDs are not illegal to use, but are merely banned by the rules of various sports. Changing the rules of those sports would simply bring them in line with the law, and what the general public is allowed to do.",Allowing athletes to use substances which are banned in the general population reinforces the problematic idea that they are above the laws and rules of society.,1

Steroids should not be banned in the first place.,Allowing athletes to use substances which are banned in the general population reinforces the problematic idea that they are above the laws and rules of society.,1
Decriminalization of drug use does not not necessarily lead to abuse. See Portugal's drug laws for an example.,"Stimulants, such as amphetamines, can be used to enhance performance. The abuse of these drugs will increase if it is legalised.",1
"Many PEDs are not illegal to use, but are merely banned by the rules of various sports. Changing the rules of those sports would simply bring them in line with the law, and what the general public is allowed to do.",Governments invest heavily in sports because of their role in promoting healthy living and exercise. This public health message is compromised at the point many athletes are using drugs.,1

Changing the rules of those sports would simply bring them in line with the law, and what the general public is allowed to do.",Advertisers are not likely to respond positively to having their brand associated with the use of substances which are illegal for the majority of the population.,1
Major drug scandals are currently economically devastating for advertisers. Getting rid of anti-doping regulation insulates them from these shocks.,Advertisers are not likely to respond positively to having their brand associated with the use of substances which are illegal for the majority of the population.,1
"Even though illegal, most doping regimens are done under the supervision of a doctor.","Attempting to emulate the performance of athletes who are using steroids can be dangerous for 'normal' people who may either push themselves too hard trying to reach the standards of their sports heroes, or use steroids without appropriate medical supervision.",1

Many athletes already use illegal drugs such as amphetamines to improve their performance.,Steroid use sends a negative message to the general population about drug use.,1
This is a non-sequiturial fallback argument. The entire point of the argument is to allow restricted drug use for registered and monitored athletes.,Steroid use sends a negative message to the general population about drug use.,1
We could make steroids legal for the general population.,Steroid use sends a negative message to the general population about drug use.,1
