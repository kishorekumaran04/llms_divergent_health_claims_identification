"Compared to the flu, the death rate for Covid-19 patients was very high.",Death rates reduced dramatically after the Covid-19 vaccine was rolled out and administered.,1
The total number of deaths caused by Covid-19 was well above the number of deaths caused by the influenza virus.,Excess deaths caused by Covid-19 were comparable to those caused by influenza during the severe phases of influenza epidemics.,1
Severe influenza epidemics are outliers and therefore mortality rates from such phases are not indicative of the usual mortality associated with influenza.,Excess deaths caused by Covid-19 were comparable to those caused by influenza during the severe phases of influenza epidemics.,1
