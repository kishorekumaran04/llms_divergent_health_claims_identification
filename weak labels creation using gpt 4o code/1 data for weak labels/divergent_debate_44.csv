It is scientifically proven that working more than 10 hours a day is associated with a 60% increased risk of developing a cardiovascular disease.,"The mere fact that it is unhealthy is not necessarily a reason to curb the freedoms of both the worker and the employer, it is merely one consideration. There are all sorts of dangerous jobs that are perfectly legal, despite the health risks, because we believe that people have the right to freely engage in contracts for labor.",1
Human life should be valued over produced goods.,The health of a few workers is worth sacrificing if it benefits the many with any higher amount of produced goods.,1
"Although people may experience lower relative stress at home than at work, it does not follow that the level of stress they experience at work is necessarily good for their health.","According to a Penn State research team, many people experience lower stress (determined by measuring cortisol levels) at work than at home.",1
"The relatively higher levels of stress people experience at home are often the result of the burden of unpaid housework, which could be ameliorated by limiting the total hours required by an employer.","According to a Penn State research team, many people experience lower stress (determined by measuring cortisol levels) at work than at home.",1
The relatively higher levels of stress people experience at home may be the result of a work culture without clearly delimited hours in which employees always worry they should or could be working more.,"According to a Penn State research team, many people experience lower stress (determined by measuring cortisol levels) at work than at home.",1

"True, but this also means that the potential for error exists at every change of shift, regardless of shift length. In these professions, reduction of error could be addressed at the level of systems (i.e. staggered shifts for support staff such as nurses, improvements to record-keeping and communication systems, etc.)","There are professions (for example, doctors) for which every change of shift is a possible error-knob.",1
Tired doctors are also more error-prone. Long shifts in the medical professions are associated with increases in error.,"There are professions (for example, doctors) for which every change of shift is a possible error-knob.",1
"Any law regarding worker safety may limit employment opportunities because of the cost to the employer. Requiring a factory to install fire safety equipment costs capital and potentially limits new jobs. However, if the primary job of a state is to protect the safety of citizens, then a state can require this equipment to protect workers, regardless of the cost to the employer. Because the length of the workday affects employee health, states have the right to legislate hours in the same way.","If the legal work day is lengthened, more jobs will become available for the very poor as a result of particular businesses becoming more productive and therefore having the capital to hire more workers. It is unjust for the state to limit the employment opportunities of consenting adults, especially when the alternative is, for many, unemployment.",1
"If the 10hour+ days were banned, the companies would need to hire more to compensate for hours lost on the ban. The difference could mean more people being able to get jobs, which would then lead to less unemployment instead.","Banning 10+ hour days will negatively affect the economy, especially unemployment.",1
"If the 10hour+ days were banned, the companies would need to hire more to compensate for hours lost on the ban. The difference could mean more people being able to get jobs, which would then lead to less unemployment instead.",More jobs to get the same amount of work would mean more benefits required to payout and more overhead costs. This would lead to less of an incentive for employers to hire.,1
"The impact to the economy should not be the primary consideration when a state legislates on issues that impact the health and safety of citizens. States are often forced to engage in cost-benefit considerations, and states should be willing to accept a reasonable economic cost if the potential risk to worker health and safety presents a compelling enough case to warrant legislation.","Banning 10+ hour days will negatively affect the economy, especially unemployment.",1
