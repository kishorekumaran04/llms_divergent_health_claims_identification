There are existing legal precedents to guarantee health care as a right in the US.,"The right to health care already violates the fifth amendment of the constitution because it takes Doctors and Hospitals' private property for public use, without just compensation. The law requires hospitals to take indigent patients without compensation.",1

"The preamble of the US Constitution states to ""promote the general welfare"" of our nation. By providing universal healthcare, the general welfare of our society would improve.","There is a difference between promoting general welfare and providing it, so it is not a right to have healthcare.",1
"The preamble of the US Constitution states to ""promote the general welfare"" of our nation. By providing universal healthcare, the general welfare of our society would improve.",The Supreme Court has never interpreted the Constitution as providing a right to health care at the expense of the government to those who cannot afford it (p.2).,1
"The preamble of the US Constitution states to ""promote the general welfare"" of our nation.

"Lots of people go bankrupt because they don't receive the medical support they need and have to stop working.

Senator Sanders has written extensively on how a universal healthcare system could be funded without placing the US into debt.,"According to Kenneth Thorpe, a researcher at Emory University, payroll and income taxes would have to increase to 20% rather than the 8.4% in the Sanders plan. Therefore, Sander's plan is not entirely accurate and it's reliability can be questioned.",1
"There are a host of taxation options (pp. 2-4) available, from placing taxes on employers as a contribution to the healthcare of their workers, rather than individually covering health insurance, to progressive taxation, wealth tax (or taxation on wealthy areas of industry) and removing tax exemptions applied in the current system.",A wealth tax has significant opposition: some argue that it would be economically damaging for the USA.,1
