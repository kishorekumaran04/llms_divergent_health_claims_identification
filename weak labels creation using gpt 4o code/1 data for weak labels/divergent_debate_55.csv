States could step in to recreate high risk pools to help those with pre-existing conditions get covered,"People with pre-existing conditions will have to pay much more. The unhealthiest people (those with cancer, or that need an organ transplant) will have to pay A LOT more - to the point where it will be unaffordable",1
States could step in to recreate high risk pools to help those with pre-existing conditions get covered,"If policy redistributes the high risk to the state, by definition a smaller pool will have higher volatility. Shifting to states simply shifts the burden to the state taxpayer general fund rather than the national health risk pool so it is a shell game with less incentive for improvement.",1
This is not the case in practice. The state charges an exorbitant fee for high risk pool people which they simply can't afford.,"If policy redistributes the high risk to the state, by definition a smaller pool will have higher volatility. Shifting to states simply shifts the burden to the state taxpayer general fund rather than the national health risk pool so it is a shell game with less incentive for improvement.",1
Health insurance will be more affordable for those without pre-existing conditions,"As people get older, they tend to have more health problems. The younger healthy people could very well find themselves locked into an expensive high risk pool or lose their insurance entirely as they age. A lot of bankruptcies in America are due to an unexpected medical emergency.",1
"More healthy people will opt to buy insurance, improving the risk pool","As was evident before the mandate in the ACA, healthy people more often then not, did not buy health insurance. That trend may not change as it is a mindset, they think that they do not need it.",1
"More healthy people will opt to buy insurance, improving the risk pool","Healthy people may not buy insurance because they perceive it as unnecessary, and thus that may not change by making variations to the risk pool.",1
"If cost is one of the main reasons they don't buy insurance, that could be reduced by a healthier pool, thus making more healthy people buying it.","Healthy people may not buy insurance because they perceive it as unnecessary, and thus that may not change by making variations to the risk pool.",1
"People without insurance going to the Emergency room is not a reasonable answer. This increases the cost of medical care for everyone because having uninsured people do that is much more expensive than providing them with affordable insurance and a GP, especially for non-emergency conditions. Adequate healthcare should include preventative care which the uninsured never get.","People who can't afford insurance may get care anyway, increasing the amount of bad debt at hospitals",1
"As private insurance companies are also legally entitled to seek profit, the state should be the one responsible for providing those rights.",The United States has civil rights laws that state that there must be equal access and equal rights for those with disabilities and health issues.,1
