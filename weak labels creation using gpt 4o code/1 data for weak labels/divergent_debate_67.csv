It's also possible that unicorns exist. But until there is evidence that either homeopathy or unicorns exist, they will both be rejected as unsupported mythology.",1
"Homeopathic consultations take into account more of the patient's condition than just the symptoms allopathic treatment would focus on.

It is the doctor who has the knowledge and experience to make such decision. Doctors spend a lot of time informing themselves about new research posted and are totally aware of the problems that antibiotics present. If they prescribe them, it is because they consider there is no better choice. Refusing to hear their informed advice would be highly irresponsible.",1
