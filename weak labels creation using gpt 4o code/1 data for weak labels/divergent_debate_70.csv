"This would only be true if mandatory organ donation resulted in the instant elimination of transplant waiting lists. In reality, a healthcare system would likely have to pay for both artificial organ maintenance procedures and transplants for many years before this could be achieved.","Healthcare professionals will know that the timely replacement of failing organs is the most cost effective way to keep a patient with organ failure alive, and so more organ transplants would leave a greater portion of overall budget to fund other in-need areas of a country's healthcare systems.",1
"This would only be true if mandatory organ donation resulted in the instant elimination of transplant waiting lists. In reality, a healthcare system would likely have to pay for both artificial organ maintenance procedures and transplants for many years before this could be achieved.",A study on liver transplant patients indicated that an increased supply of donor organs could more than double the number of successful liver recipients while increasing the average total cost per patient - including 'hidden' costs while on the waiting list - by only 37% (p. 1008).,1
"Organs must be extracted and stored under very specific conditions and in short timeframes (p. 2, 7).

"Spain, which is the world leader in organ transplants and uses an opt-out system, still has a wait time for organs varying from three months to one and a half years.","This may have less to do with organ supply and more to do with the dysfunction of Spain's healthcare system, which has suffered significant funding cuts in recent years.",1
"For those on the transplant waiting list, the mortality rate in Spain has been as high as 7% (p. 18).","The morality rate in Spain is substantially lower than most other countries. For example, in the UK around 25% of the people waiting for lung transplants over the last ten years have died.",1
"Implementation would be difficult, as the initial change from an opt-in to an opt-out system would be a decisive and likely divisive step for a government to take, particularly in highly polarized countries like America.","The nudge theory supports that there is a tendency for humans to avoid taking decisive action surrounding issues perceived as complicated or taboo, regardless of their fundamental stance on such issues. Automatic donor registration removes this phenomenon.",1
"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the introduction of opt-out legislation, independent of other variables, leads to higher donation rates.",Presumed consent or opt-out organ donation laws address the organ scarcity problem without forcing anyone to do anything.,1
"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the introduction of opt-out legislation, independent of other variables, leads to higher donation rates.","While other variables and measures contribute to Spain's high organ donation rate, its comprehensive opt-out organ donation system is widely recognized as the primary cause.",1
"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the introduction of opt-out legislation, independent of other variables, leads to higher donation rates.","Despite cultural and economic development similarities, Germany has an organ donation consent rate of 12% with an opt-in system, while Austria has a rate of 99.9% with an opt-out system.",1
"Spain first introduced its opt-out system in 1979; however, it was only with the introduction of their National Transplant Organisation (ONT) a decade later that donation rates saw significant increases.","While other variables and measures contribute to Spain's high organ donation rate, its comprehensive opt-out organ donation system is widely recognized as the primary cause.",1
"Spain first introduced its opt-out system in 1979; however, it was only with the introduction of their National Transplant Organisation (ONT) a decade later that donation rates saw significant increases.","Organ donation and healthcare reform take time to establish, thus such a delay is to be expected.",1
The increase in organ donation rates in Spain is comparable to the one seen in countries with non-opt-out systems such as the United States.,"While other variables and measures contribute to Spain's high organ donation rate, its comprehensive opt-out organ donation system is widely recognized as the primary cause.",1
Opt-out organ donation laws preserve the possibility that someone could miss out on a lifesaving organ transplant because a viable donor opted out.,Presumed consent or opt-out organ donation laws address the organ scarcity problem without forcing anyone to do anything.,1
"Principles that prioritize autonomy, like the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), are not viable because the enforcement of laws that violate these principles is necessary for a successfully functional society.",Making organ donation mandatory limits the freedoms and choices that an individual can make about their body.,1
"Principles that prioritize autonomy, like the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), are not viable because the enforcement of laws that violate these principles is necessary for a successfully functional society.","Laws that protect autonomy, though impractical, are important because they protect negative liberty, the freedom to act without limitations imposed by others. They should therefore be upheld in spite of practical considerations.",1
"Upon their death and regardless of their wishes, a person's wealth and property is subject to mandatory death duties such as an inheritance tax. Mandatory organ donation merely extends the same principle to people's bodies.",Taxation and organ collection after death are not analogous because the value of one's body cannot be compared to taxable forms of wealth.,1
"Upon their death and regardless of their wishes, a person's wealth and property is subject to mandatory death duties such as an inheritance tax. Mandatory organ donation merely extends the same principle to people's bodies.","Taxation is considered a form of state-mandated coercion and theft by many, so drawing this parallel does not necessarily make mandating organ donation justifiable.",1
"The right to bodily autonomy ends upon death, so mandatory organ donation does not infringe upon or significantly change this right.",Mandatory organ donation infringes upon a person's bodily autonomy.,1
"The right to bodily autonomy ends upon death, so mandatory organ donation does not infringe upon or significantly change this right.","While it is not possible to exercise one's rights after death, living people have the power to determine how their remains and property will be treated upon their death.",1
"The right to bodily autonomy ends upon death, so mandatory organ donation does not infringe upon or significantly change this right.","The dead retain or are granted certain de facto legal rights due to cultural norms surrounding the importance of dignity and respect for decedents’ wishes, which are often enforced against the opinions of the living (pp. 763-4).",1
"Families, hospitals, coroners and legal executors can override the bodily autonomy of the dead; mandating organ donation is merely extending this same power to the state.",Families are rarely granted the power to override a living will. In most cases families can only make the decision for someone without explicit preferences.,1
"Families, hospitals, coroners and legal executors can override the bodily autonomy of the dead; mandating organ donation is merely extending this same power to the state.",The failure of the law to respect bodily autonomy does not make this acceptable or just.,1
"Mandatory organ donation laws have no direct impact on the individual freedoms and choices a person consciously enjoys while alive, given they only take effect after death.",Enacting mandatory organ donation laws could negatively impact an individual's sense of freedom for years if they have rejected organ donation with the knowledge that this choice will be ignored upon their death.,1
"The contents of legally binding wills, including an individual's funeral wishes, can be overridden in multiple circumstances.",Anyone over the age of 18 who is deemed legally mentally competent can create a legally binding will that can include funeral and organ donation preferences.,1
