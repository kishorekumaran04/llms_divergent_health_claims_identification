Digitization can lead to better health outcomes.,"Ultimately, people's decisions to live a healthier lifestyle are the only things that will lead to better health outcomes.",1
"This doesn't mean that digitalization would interfere with that. People's decisions to live a healthier lifestyle can by any means coexist with digitalization, probably even better thanks to the methodical categorization of risk factors and patient parameters, while other conditions on which people's decision have little to no impact (i.e. congenital/hereditary diseases) can be treated undoubtedly more efficiently","Ultimately, people's decisions to live a healthier lifestyle are the only things that will lead to better health outcomes.",1
"Advancements in medicine and medical science, discovery of ways to prevent or cure diseases like diabetes will improve health outcomes. Vaccines do improved health outcomes, treating genetic predisposition to cancer will improve health outcomes. Saying that it is only peoples decision to live a healthier lifestyle which will improve health outcomes is ignoring hundreds of years of medical evidence and discovery.","Ultimately, people's decisions to live a healthier lifestyle are the only things that will lead to better health outcomes.",1
Digitization can lead to more effective treatments.,"Although it may be easier to coordinate resources, it is not going to affect the basic standard of medication or medical intervention.",1
The ability to share health data opens new possibilities for both patients and practitioners.,There is a potential issue of safety and security of personal information when it is all held online.,1
All hospitals and surgeries will need to update their systems periodically; digitalisation is just another strand of such updates.,Digitization may be difficult to achieve due to outdated infrastructures in hospitals and GP offices.,1
Patients seeking the convenience of digitized records will migrate to service providers offering the service.,Digitization may be difficult to achieve due to outdated infrastructures in hospitals and GP offices.,1
"This also means patients could wind up self-diagnosing, incorrectly, based on online symptoms. Doctors are invariably better at diagnostics than an individual on the Internet.","A system change would affect authority positions in the medical profession, as patients can question their doctors' diagnoses.",1
"Status quo healthcare workers, such as doctors or nurses, can use digitalization to strengthen their services.",Digitization challenges the status quo.,1
Doctors can do video consultations and therewith filter out unprofitable patients.,One would hope that 'profitability' is not a doctor's primary concern.,1
This is no sense a bad thing; no medical service is perfect.,Digitization challenges the status quo.,1
Digitisation will improve diagnostic methods through collecting data. This would ultimately improve treatments and reduce costs.,"Money would be better spent researching actual treatments, rather than streamlining an already operable system.",1
This doesn't negate how important it is for the development of healthcare.,"Implementation costs can be too prohibitive, especially for publicly-funded systems.",1
"It means prioritising digitalisation, if that is considered to be the next frontier in medical care, and budgeting for it where necessary.","Implementation costs can be too prohibitive, especially for publicly-funded systems.",1
A study found that up to EUR 34 billion in potential value could have been realized in 2018 if the German healthcare system had been fully digitized,"Implementation costs can be too prohibitive, especially for publicly-funded systems.",1
