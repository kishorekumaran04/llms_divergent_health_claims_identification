"Medicine reduces risks of injury and death, allowing people who lack common sense to survive.","Common sense is ultimately a subjective notion. It is not passed from one generation to the next, only the qualities attributed to the idea of common sense.",1
"Medicine reduces risks of injury and death, allowing people who lack common sense to survive.","Some people may get themselves injured through a lack of common sense in everyday situations, yet they may excel in other areas, thus contributing to human evolution.",1
"Stupidity, in the long term, is the most destructive trait that medicine allows to survive.","There is no definitive set of traits that either scientists or laymen use to ascribe stupidity to an individual, let alone a whole species. Stupidity is a matter of perspective, or more fundamentally perception.",1
"Stupidity, in the long term, is the most destructive trait that medicine allows to survive.",Medicine also allows people with great intelligence to survive and reproduce.,1
"Stupidity, in the long term, is the most destructive trait that medicine allows to survive.","Medicine does not cure or prevent stupidity. It cures people with injuries, disease or body weakness.",1
"Stupidity, in the long term, is the most destructive trait that medicine allows to survive.","The percentage of events where a person gets injured because of a stupid decision is rather low compared to disease and epidemics, accidents, war, and any other event that is no fault of their own.",1
"Stupidity, in the long term, is the most destructive trait that medicine allows to survive.","Stupidity, by itself, furthers human evolution and does not undermine it since stupid individuals oftentimes remove themselves from the gene pool.",1
"Intelligence seems to be an actual measurable trait by something commonly called the G-Factor, driving capacities to recognize patterns and adjust to changes as well as opportunities regardless of the context. Lacking these traits is fine in a modern society, but an apocalyptic event would simply kill most of these people.","There is no definitive set of traits that either scientists or laymen use to ascribe stupidity to an individual, let alone a whole species. Stupidity is a matter of perspective, or more fundamentally perception.",1
Medical technology allows very weak members of the species to survive and reproduce.,Just because someone gets sick or injured does not mean they are a weak member of the species.,1
Medical technology allows very weak members of the species to survive and reproduce.,"The ""weak"" have other qualities to offer that are beneficial to the species.",1
Medical technology allows very weak members of the species to survive and reproduce.,"We generally consider it inappropriate to judge the worth of life based on whether an individual is weak. Otherwise, we would consider handicapped people a problem for society.",1
Medical technology allows very weak members of the species to survive and reproduce.,The fact that someone is surviving is sufficient evidence of their strength to do so.,1
"Natural selection by means of removing members from the gene pool has been the primary method of evolution since the beginning of life. Survival of the fittest, death of the weakest.","Humans have long ago overcome this evolutionary mechanism, for example through the development and use of tools that allow otherwise weak individuals to thrive.",1
"In the event of a natural disaster in which (large parts) of these tools and systems are wiped out, weak individuals will suffer enormously, since their survival depends on them.","Humans have long ago overcome this evolutionary mechanism, for example through the development and use of tools that allow otherwise weak individuals to thrive.",1
"According to a new study that asserts humans are still evolving according to Charles Darwin's natural selection theory, humans are growing weaker and more disease-prone.","Humans have long ago overcome this evolutionary mechanism, for example through the development and use of tools that allow otherwise weak individuals to thrive.",1
Contributing to society does not mean contributing to the species' evolution. It only contributes to the environmental factors surrounding the evolution.,Many people who would have died without modern medicine go on to contribute a lot to society.,1
"Technology allows humans to conquer and even eradicate problems that have held us back, such as malaria. There are many extrinsic causes of disease and death that have little to do with someone's inherent fitness and more to do with random chance. Removing those problems actually improves the effectiveness of evolution.",Many people get sick or injured by chance rather than because they are a weak member of the species.,1
Having a propensity to get sick or injured indicates that the individual has problematic genetic traits.,Just because someone gets sick or injured does not mean they are a weak member of the species.,1
"While someone may not be extremely weak, if they get injured or sick then perhaps they possess traits that are not ideal for their given environment. If someone falls off a ladder because they lack caution or a sense of balance, that trait may be good to remove from the gene pool.",A lack of caution is hardly a permanent trait of individuals; it is rather something that can occur to even the strongest ones.,1
"While someone may not be extremely weak, if they get injured or sick then perhaps they possess traits that are not ideal for their given environment. If someone falls off a ladder because they lack caution or a sense of balance, that trait may be good to remove from the gene pool.",This has little to do with medicine. We need to split between injuries and death that are curable by medicine from the ones that cannot if we are to debate about medicineâ€™s influence over evolution.,1
These attributes do not necessarily facilitate human evolution.,Individuals like Stephen Hawking may be physically weak or even disabled yet are able to contribute a lot to humanity and its knowledge about the universe.,1
These attributes do not necessarily facilitate human evolution.,"With improved knowledge about the universe, humans may be able to populate other planets and thus increase the chances of the human species surviving.",1
"This is based on a restricted definition of weakness. We should rather define ""weakness"" as a genetical disadvantage which should not permit survival until time of reproduction.","The ""weak"" have other qualities to offer that are beneficial to the species.",1
Human evolution is not concerned with fairness or morality; something can be a blessing for the evolution of the human species and at the same time be deeply morally wrong.,"We generally consider it inappropriate to judge the worth of life based on whether an individual is weak. Otherwise, we would consider handicapped people a problem for society.",1
"Medical technology makes it possible for someone to survive or even reproduce despite being in a vegetative state. This is entirely a reflection of the strength of modern medicine, and not the individual.",The fact that someone is surviving is sufficient evidence of their strength to do so.,1
"No other technology allows defective genes to be transferred to next generations, thus no other technology has a macroscopical impact to the species' evolution.",Modern medicine is no different than any other technology that allows us to thrive in circumstances that we otherwise couldn't.,1
"No other technology allows defective genes to be transferred to next generations, thus no other technology has a macroscopical impact to the species' evolution.","Even without medicine, some defective genes would be transferred to the next generation. For example, the genes that cause cancer and heart disease are oftentimes only noticed at high age and after reproduction.",1
"No other technology allows defective genes to be transferred to next generations, thus no other technology has a macroscopical impact to the species' evolution.",Skill in weaponery (build or usage) has nothing to do with medicine. Yet it allowed genes considered defective before (body muscle weakness) to become irrelevant and then still transferred to next generation. It did have macrocospical impact on evolution.,1
"So far, genetic engineering exists mostly as hype and fantasy. It has not yet become a reality on a relevant scale.","With widespread genetic engineering becoming a possibility, we no longer have to rely on chance to improve the human gene pool through death - we can improve the gene pool ourselves, without harming anyone.",1
It is foreseeable the genetic engineering will be highly regulated by governments. This will limit its impact on the species and its future development.,"With widespread genetic engineering becoming a possibility, we no longer have to rely on chance to improve the human gene pool through death - we can improve the gene pool ourselves, without harming anyone.",1
Genetic Engineering could be used to reinforce eugenics and similar beliefs.,"With widespread genetic engineering becoming a possibility, we no longer have to rely on chance to improve the human gene pool through death - we can improve the gene pool ourselves, without harming anyone.",1
Genetic screening has led to the growth of sex-selective abortion. This could harm human evolution if the ratio of women to men falls so much that it impacts fertility and birth rates.,Genetic screening can help speed up human evolution.,1
"It rather ensures that everyone survives, regardless of whether they are strong or weak. And since the weak profit more than the strong, it benefits them dis-proportionally.",Modern medicine serves human evolution since it ensures that the strongest survive.,1
