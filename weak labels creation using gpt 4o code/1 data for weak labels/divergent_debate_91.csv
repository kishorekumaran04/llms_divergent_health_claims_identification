Use of the herbicide glyphosate has dramatically increased since the introduction of GM glyphosate-tolerant crops. Glyphosate can be linked to many health problems.,Multiple studies linking glyphosate to numerous health risks have been discredited as unsupported by the available scientific evidence.,1
"The recent rise in celiac disease correlates with the increased use of glyphosate on wheat crops and the presence of gluten proteins. For those with a genetic predisposition, the glyphosate found on genetically modified foods may exacerbate, or trigger the onset of, celiac disease (p. 160).","While the study referenced above touches on possible mechanisms of causation, it neither proves nor investigates the relationship between these mechanisms and the rise in incidence of celiac disease. For example, the study used glyphosate levels that were thousands of times higher than those present in genetically modified foods, the latter of which are too low to alter gut bacteria (p. 1).",1
"Research suggests that glyphosate-based herbicides could be linked to birth defects, cancer, kidney disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",Several external organisations have found major flaws (such as the reliance on animal studies) and evidence of unreported non-carcinogenic findings in the IARC's study that may significantly affect the conclusions drawn.,1
"Research suggests that glyphosate-based herbicides could be linked to birth defects, cancer, kidney disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","In the cited study regarding birth defects, the authors state that the results are preliminary and must be confirmed through additional research (p. 1).",1
"Since glyphosate use seemed to become prevalent only in conjunction with the widespread adoption of GM crops (p. 175), it follows that if GM crops were phased out, glyphosate use would likely be reduced or eradicated along with it.","Glyphosate use is not intrinsically linked to GMOs, thus if it is glyphosate and not GM food that has dangerous side effects, it would be far more logical to ban glyphosate than GMOs.",1
"Since glyphosate use seemed to become prevalent only in conjunction with the widespread adoption of GM crops (p. 175), it follows that if GM crops were phased out, glyphosate use would likely be reduced or eradicated along with it.","There are other key reasons for the global increase in glyphosate that are not entirely linked to the rise of GMOs: its perceived lack of toxicity, relatively low price (p. 175), and its use in the growing practices of both pre-harvest crop desiccation and ripening sugar cane (p. 159).",1
Genetically modified organisms may have irreversibly harmful impacts on the efficacy of vital medicines and treatments due to increased antibiotic resistance.,"Many diseases cause unnecessary health complications and deaths due to a lack of available vaccines (p. 1).

"Not everything in life is necessarily practical, especially when it comes to food.",The evolution of plants by natural selection does not necessarily result in desirable or practical crops for humans. Their modification has thus been a necessary practice throughout history in order to cultivate ones more suitable for human consumption.,1
"Monoculture cropping leaves large yields of crop vulnerable to the same diseases and blights, carrying the risk of wiping out a massive quantity all at once.","Humanity has been creating and using GMOs throughout history via selective breeding, a form of monoculture.

With this in mind, the similarities are not enough to conclude that modern GMO foods pose no greater risks than long-established, non-GMO ones.","Many 'conventional' agricultural practices, such as mutation or radiation breeding, were only introduced relatively recently or have changed significantly over time, meaning they cannot be seen as less risky to human health by virtue of their longevity.",1
"Atomic gardening, which has been around since the 1950s, involves safely exposing plants to gamma rays in order to genetically alter them.

"Pollen can travel large distances and overcome obstacles such as barrier crops, meaning it easily and indiscriminately spreads genes between conventional crops and genetically modified crops. Thus, the process of natural pollination has the potential to eventually render entire species 'genetically modified'.",Crops could be altered so that the pollen produced by the plant doesn't contain the modified gene (p. 268).,1
"There are limitations to all transgene containment strategies, with no method having ever proved itself broadly effective for all crop species.","There are a variety of existing and developing technologies for transgene containment in genetically modified crops and weeds, including maternal inheritance, male sterility, and seed sterility (p. 1).",1

Tilling is not a hard requirement for farming non-GMO produce: a number of farms growing non-GMO crops support less mainstream methods of land management that reduce or eliminate the need to till.,"Conventional tilling, needed to keep non-GM crop fields weed-free, strips the soil of many nutrients, increases erosion and run-off, and harms earthworm populations. Herbicide-resistant GMOs reduce the need for this.",1

"Governments are obligated to protect their citizens.

"Given that the children still have to consent to the donation, this does not infringe upon consent or bodily autonomy.","For children's organs to match parents' organs, they require matching blood types.
