Submissives in BDSM relationships give their partners a huge amount of control and power over them. It is easy for this power to be abused.,Any power that a dominant holds is rooted in the giving of power by the submissive. It is not easy to abuse such power since a submissive can revoke it at will.,

"Consensual non-consent (CNC) practices simulate abuse and may appear to be violent, abusive, and/or lacking the consent of one or more parties.",Simulations are not equivalent to actual activities. Simulated abuse is not real and has controls that prevent it from causing harm.,
"Total power exchange (TPE) relationships use blanket consent, wherein a submissive gives consent in advance of a scene where participants behave as if it has been waived.

"BDSM may normalise suffering as a cultural performance instead of disrupting or complicating its social role (p. 187). This may create a false consciousness that perpetuates the suffering of vulnerable groups, making BDSM abusive.","Many activities can be abused but are not inherently abusive. Given that BDSM does not take away people's autonomy when negotiating their relationship to pain (p. 13), it is illegitimate to categorise it as uniquely malicious.",
"The potential for serious emotional harm is far greater in BDSM than it is in such everyday situations, as some practices focus specifically on the manipulation of emotions, which can have lasting repercussions.","There are many everyday situations that carry the risk of emotional pain.

The therapeutic use of pain management techniques by a small subset of BDSM practitioners does not preclude abusive behavior in other subgroups.,Participation in BDSM has recently emerged as a useful way for people with chronic pain to learn better pain management techniques.

"The complexity of polyamory can make relationships unstable and increase interpersonal conflict. If BDSM encourages these situations, it may leave people open to harm and make liberation unlikely.","Some BDSM groups embrace sex acts with multiple partners and view them as liberatory (p. 2).
