"Some women who are pressured out of getting an abortion may be unwilling to give up their child, even though they are not in a financial position to support them. This will impose significant stress on the mother, and the child will grow up in an environment where their needs may not be met.","Being aborted is even worse for a child than growing up in an environment where they suffer from financial hardship, because at least in the latter case the child is still alive.",

"This includes medical harm to the person carrying the fetus, which increases in later term procedures.",People still have the option of carrying the pregnancy to term.,
"People that are denied access to medical care in cases of rape or incest, with proposed and currently enacted laws being so broad as to prohibit abortion even when the fetus is diagnosed stillborn.","The cited example doesn't show that fetal pain laws are bad, it just shows that that particular fetal pain law should have been thought through more, perhaps adding a clause that inducing labor in a way that harms neither mother nor baby is acceptable.",
"If a woman carries the child to term and then gives it up for adoption, she will suffer further emotional trauma from the knowledge that she was unable to care for the child that she carried for 9 months and developed strong hormonal connections to.","A woman who aborts their child was also unable to care for them, so it is unclear how the consequences of carrying a child to term and having someone adopt them would be worse than an abortion.",

Protests at abortion clinics are an important form of resistance for this community.,
"Abortion, and abortion consultations are medical procedures. No one should have to face threats of harm and harassment to access any medical procedures.","Medical procedures that cause harm to another person, such as a doctor prescribing thalidomide to a pregnant woman, should be opposed.",
"Setting aside the opinion of abortion, it comes down to providing reasonable protections from damages caused by the menacing behaviors of clinic protestors, whose tactics are meant to cause fear and distress, as well as long-term mental and emotional anguish. Instituting preventative measures to curtail alarming behaviors is not unreasonable or unusual.","Many pro-life organizations reject the use of gore or ""invectives"" in their signs for protesting at clinics.",
The area will presumably be wide enough to make it impossible to line the perimeter with individuals. It also means that any protest cannot be targeted directly at women.,"Pro-lifers will protest outside the exclusion zones, which will be worse because they will be harder to anticipate and police, and will have less media scrutiny.",
